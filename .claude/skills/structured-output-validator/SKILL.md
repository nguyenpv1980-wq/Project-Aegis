# Structured Output Validator

## Purpose

Make an LLM's structured output safe for code to consume by treating the model
response as untrusted input that must conform to an explicit contract before
anything acts on it. The deliverable is: the output contract (required fields,
types, enums, ranges, formats) — encoded at the TYPE level where possible so a
non-compliant output is unrepresentable, not merely rejected; the fixed
validate-before-use ladder every response walks (parse → strict schema →
policy/banned-content scan), whose failures are logged as safety evidence and
rejected, never silently repaired; the failure handling (reject / bounded
repair-retry / fallback); and the semantic checks that shape validation alone
misses (value allowlists, tenant-scoped ids, referential sanity). Crucially,
shape-valid ≠ safe-to-act: this skill hands validated output onward to
`llm-output-safety-reviewer` (sinks) and `agent-tool-safety-guard` (tool
authorization), which own the harm-prevention half.

## Use When

- Use when: a model returns JSON or other structured data that application
  code parses and acts on.
- Use when: defining an enforceable output contract for an AI feature so
  malformed/unexpected responses can't crash or mislead downstream logic.
- Use when: the model output becomes function/tool arguments and the shape
  must be guaranteed before dispatch.
- Do NOT use when: the concern is what happens at an injection/execution sink
  (`llm-output-safety-reviewer`) or the tool-permission boundary
  (`agent-tool-safety-guard`) — this skill guarantees SHAPE, they guarantee
  SAFETY.
- Do NOT use when: the concern is whether the content is TRUE
  (`ai-misinformation-guard`) or the provider/routing layer
  (`ai-router-architect`).

## Inputs to Inspect

1. What downstream code does with the output: fields it reads, actions it
   drives, assumptions it makes (a missing field that throws, an enum it
   switches on).
2. The current parsing: is the response `JSON.parse`d and used directly, or
   validated against a schema first (the former is the gap).
3. The output contract if any: existing schema/types, or the implicit shape
   the code expects.
4. Semantic constraints: which values are actually allowed (status enums,
   id formats), tenant scoping of any ids, cross-field/referential rules.
5. Provider capabilities: native structured-output / JSON-mode / tool-schema
   support that can constrain generation (helpful but not sufficient).
6. Failure tolerance: can the call fail closed (reject) or does it need a
   repair/fallback path; latency/cost budget for retries.

## Workflow

1. **Define the output contract — in types where possible.** Specify the
   schema: required vs optional fields, types, enums, numeric ranges, string
   formats/lengths, array bounds, nesting. Make "what the code assumes"
   explicit and enforceable. Then encode the contract at the TYPE level where
   the implementation language allows — enums/sum types instead of free
   strings, branded ids, bounded collections — so a non-compliant output is
   UNREPRESENTABLE in downstream code, not merely caught: make the illegal
   state impossible, not just detected. The runtime schema still guards the
   wire, where types cannot reach. No downstream usage/contract to inspect →
   Stop Conditions.
2. **Validate before use, always — as a fixed ladder.** Every model response
   walks parse → strict schema → policy/banned-content scan (step 4) before
   any field is read or acted on. Direct use of `JSON.parse` output without
   validation is the finding this closes. Use provider JSON-mode/tool-schema
   to constrain generation, but STILL validate — provider modes reduce, not
   eliminate, malformed output.
3. **Add semantic validation beyond shape** using
   [references/output-validation-patterns.md](references/output-validation-patterns.md):
   values in allowed sets (not just "is a string"), ids that exist and are
   tenant-scoped to the caller, cross-field consistency, referential sanity.
   A schema-valid response can still carry a wrong-tenant id.
4. **Run the policy/banned-content scan as a NAMED ladder step.** After parse
   and schema, scan for content the contract BANS: denylisted terms or
   content classes, embedded links or instructions where none belong,
   anything the feature must never emit. A scan failure is LOGGED AS SAFETY
   EVIDENCE (what was caught, when, from which input class) and the output
   REJECTED — never silently repaired or stripped-and-passed: a quietly
   repaired violation destroys the evidence and hides the trend. Prove the
   scan can fail by seeding a banned-content fixture through it — a verifier
   that cannot fail is theater with an exit code.
5. **Specify failure handling.** On validation failure choose per use case:
   reject (fail closed — safest), bounded repair-retry (re-prompt with the
   error, capped attempts to avoid a cost loop), or fallback (default/degraded
   response). Never silently coerce or partially use invalid output.
   Repair-retry is for SHAPE failures only — a policy/banned-content failure
   is rejected and logged, never repaired into acceptability.
6. **Guard the tool-argument case.** When output becomes tool/function
   arguments, validation is the precondition to dispatch — but authorization
   is still `agent-tool-safety-guard`'s job (valid shape, wrong permission =
   still blocked). State the handoff.
7. **Hand off the safety half.** Validated output going to a render/exec/URL/
   store sink goes to `llm-output-safety-reviewer` — shape validity does not
   sanitize an XSS payload in a string field. Make the handoff explicit.
8. **Design the validation tests.** Cases: missing required field, wrong type,
   out-of-range/enum value, extra/unexpected fields, wrong-tenant id, empty/
   truncated response, non-JSON text, banned content inside a schema-valid
   response — each with the expected handling (the banned-content case must
   show log-and-reject, not repair). Hand to `ai-evaluation-harness` for the
   schema-adherence dimension.

## Output Format

```
STRUCTURED OUTPUT CONTRACT — <feature>
Schema: <fields: required/type/enum/range/format | nesting | array bounds>
Type-level encoding: <what the types make unrepresentable | where the runtime
  schema still guards the wire>
Validation ladder: parse → strict schema → policy/banned-content scan
  (<where it runs, before which action>)
Semantic checks: <value allowlists | tenant-scoped ids | cross-field/referential>
Policy scan: <banned classes | failures logged as safety evidence + rejected,
  never repaired | proven able to fail (fixture)>
Failure handling: <reject | bounded repair-retry (cap, shape-only) | fallback>
  per case
Provider constraint: <JSON-mode/tool-schema used — still validated>
Handoffs: sinks → llm-output-safety-reviewer | tool args → agent-tool-safety-guard
Validation tests: <malformed + banned-content cases → expected handling>
  (→ ai-evaluation-harness)
Residual risk: <what remains + named acceptor>
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] The output contract is explicit: required fields, types, enums, ranges,
      formats — matching what downstream code assumes.
- [ ] The contract is encoded at the type level where the language allows —
      illegal outputs unrepresentable, with the runtime schema still guarding
      the wire.
- [ ] Every response walks the full ladder (parse → strict schema →
      policy/banned-content scan) BEFORE any field is used; no direct use of
      parsed-but-unvalidated output.
- [ ] Semantic checks beyond shape are present (value allowlists, tenant-scoped
      ids, referential sanity).
- [ ] The policy/banned-content scan is a named ladder step; its failures are
      logged as safety evidence and rejected — never silently repaired — and
      the scan is proven able to fail.
- [ ] Failure handling is defined per case and never silently coerces or
      partially uses invalid output; repair-retry is bounded and shape-only.
- [ ] Tool-argument outputs are validated pre-dispatch, with authorization
      explicitly handed to `agent-tool-safety-guard`.
- [ ] Sink-bound validated output is explicitly handed to
      `llm-output-safety-reviewer` (shape ≠ safety).
- [ ] Validation test cases cover missing/wrong-type/out-of-range/extra/
      wrong-tenant/truncated/non-JSON responses.

## AI Security Rules

- Model output is untrusted input: validate against a contract before use, the
  same way you'd validate an external API response or user input.
- Shape validity is necessary, not sufficient: a schema-valid response can
  carry an XSS payload (→ `llm-output-safety-reviewer`) or a wrong-tenant id
  (semantic check + `agent-tool-safety-guard`).
- Fail closed by default: reject invalid output; repair-retry is bounded to
  avoid a cost/latency loop; never partially act on an invalid response.
- The ladder is fixed — parse → strict schema → policy/banned-content scan —
  and nothing acts on a response until it clears all three; scan failures
  are safety evidence (logged) and rejections (never silently repaired).
- A validator or scan that has never failed in a test is unproven — a
  verifier that cannot fail is theater with an exit code; prove each rung
  can fail before trusting it.
- Provider JSON-mode is a generation aid, not a validator — always validate
  on receipt.

## Gotchas

- "It's usually valid JSON" is where the outage lives: the one truncated or
  prose-wrapped response ("Sure! Here's the JSON: …") crashes an unvalidated
  parser. Validate every time.
- Schema-valid but semantically wrong is the subtle bug: `{"tenant_id":"other"}`
  passes a string check and leaks across tenants — validate values, not just
  types.
- Repair-retry loops burn money: re-prompting on every failure without a cap
  turns a bad response into a spend spike (compose
  `ai-cost-guardrail-designer`).
- Coercion hides failures: silently defaulting a missing field or truncating
  an out-of-range number produces confidently wrong behavior. Reject instead.
- Silently repairing a policy violation — stripping the banned bit and
  passing the rest — hides the very trend the safety log exists to show;
  the rejection IS the signal.
- Type-level encoding is compile-time only: the wire is untyped, so types
  without the runtime schema at the boundary are false comfort — you need
  both, each guarding what the other cannot.
- Extra fields can smuggle: a response with unexpected keys the code later
  spreads into an object can inject state. Reject unknown fields where it
  matters.
- Shape validation is not output-handling: passing validation does NOT mean
  the string is safe to render or execute — that's a separate skill.

## Stop Conditions

- No downstream usage or output contract is available — stop; the schema is
  defined by what the code needs, which must be known.
- Validation would need to run inside application code and this is a design
  handoff — propose the contract and strategy; wiring it is a normal
  (classified) implementation step.
- The real concern is a sink (render/exec), tool authorization, factual
  accuracy, or routing — hand to the owning skill.
- Validated output is still driving harm because a sink trusts it — that's
  `llm-output-safety-reviewer`; route it there.
