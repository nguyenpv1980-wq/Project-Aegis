# CI Pipeline Architect

## Purpose

Produce a delivery pipeline that is fast enough to be obeyed and strict
enough to be worth obeying: a stage graph with explicit merge-blocking
semantics, secret governance that survives a malicious PR, artifact and
cache rules, environment promotion with human gates where they belong, and
— when asked — the concrete pipeline definition files implementing it. The
discipline is gate-placement-by-evidence: every stage exists because it
catches a class of defect at the cheapest point, every merge-blocking check
earns its latency, and nothing that guards the default branch is silently
weakened.

## Use When

- Use when: asked to design or overhaul a CI/CD pipeline, or to stand one
  up for a repo that has none.
- Use when: adding, reordering, or gating pipeline stages (security scans,
  E2E, artifact publication, deploy approvals).
- Use when: fixing CI secret handling — stored cloud keys → OIDC, secret
  exposure to fork PRs, which jobs see which secrets.
- Use when: wiring deployment strategies (rolling/blue-green/canary/flag
  gated) and environment promotion into the pipeline.
- Do NOT use when: designing test-suite structure, runners, or retry/flake
  policy — `qa-automation-architect` owns the test tiers this pipeline
  hosts.
- Do NOT use when: auditing dependencies, action provenance, or CI
  compromise paths — `supply-chain-security-reviewer` (this skill applies
  its rules; the audit is its casework).
- Do NOT use when: deciding whether a specific release ships —
  `release-readiness-reviewer` consumes the gates this skill builds.
- Do NOT use when: reviewing Terraform/Bicep the pipeline deploys —
  `iac-reviewer`.

## Inputs to Inspect

1. Existing pipeline definitions (workflow YAML, pipeline files), branch
   protection rules, and environment/approval configuration.
2. The repo's build/test commands and their real runtimes (CI history) —
   stage design against measured minutes, not guesses.
3. The test-automation blueprint (`qa-automation-architect` output): tiers,
   what runs on PR vs merge vs nightly, retry policy.
4. Secret inventory: what secrets CI currently holds, which jobs/steps use
   them, and which cloud roles the pipeline can assume.
5. Deploy targets and environments: staging/production topology, who may
   approve promotion, existing deployment strategy.
6. Supply-chain posture: how actions/plugins are pinned today
   (`supply-chain-security-reviewer` findings if any).
7. Monorepo/polyrepo shape and change-detection needs (path filters,
   affected-graph tooling).

## Workflow

1. **Map the current state honestly**: stages that exist, what actually
   blocks merge (branch protection vs advisory), measured stage runtimes,
   flake-driven re-runs, secret usage per job. A pipeline design that
   ignores current runtimes produces gates people bypass.
2. **Design the stage graph**: fast static feedback first (lint, typecheck,
   format), build once and reuse the artifact, test tiers per the
   `qa-automation-architect` blueprint (unit/integration on PR; E2E per its
   tier policy), security stages (SAST, dependency/secret scanning — triage
   discipline per `static-analysis-reviewer` / `supply-chain-security-reviewer`),
   build-output QA (`vite-build-qa-engineer` for Vite estates), artifact
   packaging with provenance metadata. For each stage: trigger, blocking
   semantics (merge-blocking / post-merge / nightly), timeout, and the
   defect class it exists to catch.
3. **Govern secrets**: no long-lived cloud credentials in CI where OIDC
   federation exists — pipelines assume scoped cloud roles; secrets scoped
   to the narrowest job, never exported to PR-triggered runs from forks;
   secret-bearing jobs isolated from steps that execute untrusted code
   (install scripts, PR code); missing-secret behavior explicit (skip with
   a visible report, never silently pass).
4. **Set caching and artifact governance**: caches keyed on lockfiles
   (poisoning-aware: caches restored into secret-bearing jobs are an attack
   surface), build artifacts retained with a stated retention period,
   logs/reports/coverage/screenshots collected per the QA evidence
   conventions, artifact provenance recorded (commit, run id) so
   `release-readiness-reviewer` can demand it later.
5. **Wire environments and promotion**: environment-scoped secrets,
   promotion order (staging → production), required approvers on
   production-facing environments (named humans per
   `agent-authorization-matrix` posture — merge/deploy authority is never
   the pipeline's own decision), and the deployment strategy per target:
   rolling (default), blue/green (instant backout), canary (risk-scored
   releases), flag-gated (decouple deploy from release). Each strategy
   choice records its rollback primitive — the hook
   `rollback-runbook-author` builds on.
6. **Align branch protection**: required checks list matches the
   merge-blocking stages exactly (a "required" check that no longer runs
   blocks nothing), stale-review dismissal, and no bypass actors beyond
   the governed list.
7. **Write or edit the pipeline files** (the side-effecting step): scoped
   diff per `reviewable-diff-discipline`, pinned action/step versions per
   `supply-chain-security-reviewer` rules, no check removed or weakened
   without it being a named, approved change. Never commit secrets or
   their values into definitions.
8. **Validate and hand off**: definitions lint/parse (actionlint or
   equivalent where available), a dry-run or PR run proves the graph
   executes, measured latency per stage is reported against the budget,
   and the go/no-go evidence contract is handed to
   `release-readiness-reviewer`.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Every merge-blocking stage names the defect class it catches and its
      runtime; total PR latency is stated against a budget.
- [ ] Build happens once; downstream stages consume the artifact, not
      rebuilds.
- [ ] No long-lived cloud credential remains where OIDC federation was
      available; every secret is scoped to named jobs; fork-PR runs get no
      secrets.
- [ ] Missing-secret and skipped-stage behavior is visible, never a silent
      pass.
- [ ] Required checks in branch protection exactly match the
      merge-blocking stage list.
- [ ] Every deployment strategy records its rollback primitive.
- [ ] Actions/steps are version-pinned; no check was weakened or removed
      without a named approval.
- [ ] Test-tier internals, supply-chain audit, and release go/no-go were
      composed from their skills, not restated.
- [ ] If files were edited: diff is scoped, parsed/linted, and proven by a
      real run.

## Gotchas

- The most common pipeline failure is social, not technical: a 40-minute
  merge gate trains the team to stack PRs and admin-merge. Latency is a
  security control.
- PR-triggered workflows from forks with secret access are a standing
  exfiltration hole; `pull_request_target`-style triggers plus checkout of
  PR code is the classic misconfiguration.
- Caches restored into privileged jobs can carry poisoned artifacts from
  unprivileged runs — separate cache namespaces by trust level.
- A required check whose job was renamed blocks nothing: branch protection
  references check NAMES, and drift between workflow and protection is
  silent.
- "Temporarily" continue-on-error on a failing security stage is how scan
  gates die; expiry-dated skips only, visibly reported.
- Deploy jobs that run on every merge to main make rollback a new deploy
  race; promotion gates and concurrency groups exist for this.

## Stop Conditions

- Invoked without explicit human request → do not run; this skill edits
  behavior-steering pipeline files that execute with secret access
  (`disable-model-invocation: true` is load-bearing).
- Asked to weaken, remove, or bypass a merge-blocking check (especially
  security stages) → `human-approval-boundary` with the check, the reason,
  and the expiry; never weaken silently as part of a broader edit.
- A pipeline change would grant CI new cloud permissions or new secret
  access → propose the scoped role/secret and stop for approval.
- The change touches production deploy/approval gates → named-human
  approval per `agent-authorization-matrix` posture before the edit ships.
- Existing pipeline behavior cannot be observed (no CI history/permissions)
  → design from the repo with assumptions labeled; do not present an
  unvalidated graph as measured.

## Supporting Files

- `references/pipeline-stages.md` — canonical stage catalog with blocking
  semantics, secret-governance patterns (OIDC, fork posture), and
  deployment-strategy → rollback-primitive table.
- `evals/evals.json` — trigger + behavior cases.
- `evals/trigger-evals.json` — discrimination within the delivery cluster
  (`release-readiness-reviewer`, `rollback-runbook-author`) and against
  shipped `qa-automation-architect` / `supply-chain-security-reviewer` /
  `vite-build-qa-engineer`.
