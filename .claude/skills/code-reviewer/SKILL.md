description: 'Review an ACTUAL diff — a PR, branch delta, or staged/working changes obtained from git — and report findings by severity (blocker/major/minor/nit), each with file:line evidence and a concrete remediation. Covers correctness, security, performance, reliability, maintainability, test adequacy, and migration safety, and reads enough surrounding unchanged code to judge the change in context. Use when asked to review a diff, PR, branch, or commit. Do NOT use for behavior-preserving cleanup application (code-simplifier), whole-repository audits (full-codebase-auditor), or strategic architecture assessment of a subsystem (principal-code-analyst). Never reviews imagined code: no diff, no review.'

# Code Reviewer

## Purpose

Produce a review a maintainer can act on: findings ordered by severity, each
anchored to file:line in the real diff, each explaining the failure it causes
and the concrete fix. The review's authority comes from evidence — a claim
without an anchor and a failure scenario is an opinion, and opinions are
labeled as such or dropped. Verdict included: approve, approve-with-nits, or
request-changes, with the blocking findings named.

## Use When

- Use when: asked to review a PR, a branch against its base, a commit, or
  the current staged/working diff.
- Use when: a change is about to merge and needs a correctness/security/test
  pass with severity-ranked output.
- Do NOT use when: the request is to *apply* simplifications — that is
  `code-simplifier` (side-effecting, manual-only).
- Do NOT use when: the scope is the whole repository's health, not one change
  — that is `full-codebase-auditor`.
- Do NOT use when: the ask is a strategic architecture read on a subsystem —
  that is `principal-code-analyst`.
- Never review from a description of a change. No diff obtained = no review;
  say so.

## Inputs to Inspect

1. The actual diff: `gh pr diff <n>` / `git diff <base>...<branch>` /
   `git diff` + `git diff --staged`. Record which one was reviewed.
2. The stated intent: PR description, commit messages, linked issue — the
   review judges the diff against its declared purpose.
3. Surrounding unchanged code of every modified hunk — callers, callees, and
   invariants the hunk relies on; a diff-only read misses broken contracts.
4. The tests touched or conspicuously not touched by the change.
5. Migrations, schema, config, CI, and dependency changes riding along —
   the risky lines often hide outside `src/`.

## Workflow

1. **Obtain the real diff** and its base; note size and file spread. If it
   mixes unrelated intents, note that as a finding
   (`reviewable-diff-discipline` violation) and review anyway.
2. **Read the intent** and form the question the review answers: does this
   diff do what it claims, and only that, safely?
3. **First pass — correctness:** logic errors, inverted conditions, off-by-
   one, error paths, null/empty/boundary handling, concurrency around shared
   state. Read callers of changed functions, not just the hunks.
4. **Second pass — security:** input validation at boundaries, authz on new
   paths, injection surfaces, secrets in code/config/logs, unsafe
   deserialization, tenant-scope leaks on data access.
5. **Third pass — reliability & performance:** failure modes of new I/O
   (timeouts, retries, partial failure), resource leaks, N+1 queries, work
   moved onto hot paths, unbounded growth.
6. **Fourth pass — tests & migrations:** do tests pin the new behavior and
   its edges (would they fail if the change were reverted?); are migrations
   forward-safe, rollback-considered, and deploy-order-safe?
7. **Fifth pass — maintainability:** naming, duplication, dead code,
   convention drift — reported as minor/nit unless it hides a defect.
8. **Write findings** with severity, anchor, failure scenario, remediation.
   Uncertain claims are marked "needs verification", not asserted.
9. **Deliver the verdict** with blockers listed; note what was NOT reviewed
   (generated files, vendored code) so the human knows coverage.

## Output Format

```
CODE REVIEW — <PR/branch/diff id> (base: <ref>, N files, +A/−D)
Intent: <what the change claims to do>
Verdict: approve | approve-with-nits | request-changes
Findings (by severity):
  [BLOCKER] <file:line> — <defect>; fails when <scenario>; fix: <remediation>
  [MAJOR]   ...
  [MINOR]   ...
  [NIT]     ...
Tests: <adequate | gaps: which behaviors are unpinned>
Migrations/config/deps: <safe | findings>
Not reviewed: <exclusions + why>
Positive notes: <what the change does well — optional but earned>
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Reviewed an actual obtained diff; command recorded.
- [ ] Every finding has file:line, a failure scenario, and a remediation.
- [ ] Severity reflects impact, not annoyance — style nits are never majors.
- [ ] Callers/callees of changed code were read, not just the hunks.
- [ ] Test adequacy judged by "would the tests catch a revert?".
- [ ] Migration/dependency/CI changes in the diff got explicit attention.
- [ ] Verdict states which findings block; unverified suspicions labeled.

## Gotchas

- The bug is often in the unchanged line the diff now invalidates — review
  the contract, not the hunk in isolation.
- Renames and moves hide edits: `git diff -M` shows what actually changed
  inside "moved" files.
- A green CI run tells you the existing tests pass, not that the new behavior
  is tested — check the diff of the tests, not the badge.
- Reviewing generated files line-by-line wastes the budget; verify the
  generator input changed correspondingly and say generated output was skipped.
- Big diffs induce rubber-stamping; if attention degraded past a size,
  say where coverage got thinner rather than implying uniform scrutiny.
- Comment-only and doc changes still merit a scan — stale docs that now
  contradict the code are a finding.

## Stop Conditions

- No diff can be obtained (no branch/PR/changes) → stop; do not review from
  a verbal description.
- The diff touches security policy, RLS, auth flows, or production config in
  ways whose implications are unclear → flag for human security review via
  `human-approval-boundary`; do not approve on inference.
- The diff is so large or generated-heavy that a line-level review would be
  theater → say so, propose a split or a scoped review, and review the
  reviewable core.
- Asked to both review and silently fix the findings in one pass → review
  first; fixes are a separate, explicitly-approved change.
