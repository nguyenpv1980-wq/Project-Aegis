description: Design the authorization model for a multi-tenant SaaS as an explicit roles × permissions × resources matrix — platform roles vs tenant roles, object-level authorization rules for every tenant-owned resource, an enforcement-point map (UI, API, service, background job, integration), deny-by-default posture, impersonation/support-access rules, and a negative-test plan proving forbidden actions actually fail. Includes an additive migration and rollback path for role changes. Use when designing or overhauling roles and permissions, when authorization checks are scattered and inconsistent across the codebase, when adding a sensitive capability or a new role, or when support/admin access needs safe rules. Do NOT use for plan/feature gating — "does this PLAN include X" is plan-entitlement-architect; "can this ROLE do X" is this skill. Not for recording what happened (audit-log-architect) or for auditing existing RLS policies (Phase 4 security pack).

# Authorization Matrix Designer

## Purpose

Produce an authorization model where every allow is written down and
everything else is denied: a roles × permissions × resources matrix, the
object-level rules that stop cross-tenant and cross-user reach-through, a map
of exactly where each check is enforced, brokered rules for support and
impersonation, and negative tests for the denials that matter. The discipline:
authorization is a designed matrix with enforcement points, not an
accumulation of `if (user.isAdmin)` checks discovered later by a pen test.

## Use When

- Use when: designing roles and permissions for a new product or feature
  area, or overhauling a grown-wild permission system.
- Use when: authorization decisions are scattered — some in UI, some in
  handlers, some in SQL — and behave inconsistently across surfaces.
- Use when: adding a sensitive capability (billing changes, data export, member
  removal, API keys) that needs an explicit permission and a denial test.
- Use when: support/admin staff need access to tenant data and the rules for
  it don't exist yet.
- Do NOT use when: the gate is commercial — "is feature X in the Pro plan" is
  `plan-entitlement-architect`. A request may need both; keep the axes
  separate: role says CAN, plan says INCLUDED.
- Do NOT use when: designing the audit record of actions taken — that is
  `audit-log-architect` (this skill only requires that high-privilege grants
  emit audit events).
- Do NOT use when: tenant semantics/membership are undefined — run
  `tenant-modeler` first; roles attach to memberships.

## Inputs to Inspect

1. The tenant model — especially the membership model, since roles attach to
   memberships (tenant-modeler output).
2. Existing authorization code: role enums/tables, permission checks in
   middleware/handlers/UI, ad-hoc `isAdmin`/`isOwner` conditionals.
3. The resource inventory: every tenant-owned resource type and the sensitive
   actions on each (export, delete, share, invite, billing, keys).
4. Every enforcement surface that exists: UI, API routes, service layer,
   background jobs, integrations/webhooks, admin console.
5. Current support/staff access practice — what actually happens today when
   support needs to see tenant data.
6. Compliance requirements naming access control (SOC 2, ISO, customer
   contracts demanding least privilege or access reviews).

## Workflow

1. **Inventory resources and actions.** Every tenant-owned resource type ×
   its actions, flagging the sensitive ones. This is the matrix's column
   space; an action not in the inventory cannot be secured.
2. **Inventory actors.** Tenant roles (owner, admin, member, guest — per the
   tenant model), platform/staff roles, service accounts, API keys/machine
   actors. Platform roles that can cross tenant boundaries get enumerated
   individually — they are the dangerous ones.
3. **Build the matrix**: role × permission × resource, deny-by-default —
   cells are explicit allows; absent means denied. Use the template in
   [references/authorization-matrix-template.md](references/authorization-matrix-template.md).
   Keep permissions named as verb-resource pairs, not role names.
4. **Write the object-level rules.** Role checks answer "may this role do
   this action"; object rules answer "on THIS resource" — membership in the
   owning tenant, ownership of the object, sharing grants. Every tenant-owned
   resource gets an object rule; endpoint-level checks alone are an IDOR
   design.
5. **Map enforcement points.** For each surface (UI, API, service, jobs,
   integrations): where the check runs and which layer is authoritative. UI
   hides, API enforces — write that down. Jobs and integrations enforce the
   same matrix; they are not exempt.
6. **Design brokered access**: support/impersonation is explicit-grant,
   scoped to a tenant, time-boxed, visible to the tenant where promised, and
   every use emits an audit event. Raw production access is not a support
   role.
7. **Define the negative-test plan**: for each sensitive permission and each
   privileged role boundary, a test where the disallowed actor attempts the
   action and the expected result is denial — including revoked-membership,
   cross-tenant, and expired-impersonation cases (catalog in references).
8. **Plan migration and rollback** for role changes: introduce new
   permissions additively, dual-check (old and new logic in shadow
   comparison) before cutover, keep a flag to revert to the old check, and
   never widen a role's reach silently — widening is a change the human
   approves.

## Output Format

```
AUTHORIZATION DESIGN — <scope>
Actor inventory: <tenant roles / platform roles (cross-tenant ones flagged) /
  machine actors>
Resource-action inventory: <resource × actions; sensitive actions flagged>
Matrix: role × permission × resource (explicit allows; deny by default)
Object-level rules: <resource → rule (membership/ownership/grant)>
Enforcement-point map: <surface → where the check runs → authoritative layer>
Brokered access rules: <grant, scope, time-box, visibility, audit event>
Negative-test plan: <actor — attempted action — expected denial>
Migration & rollback: <additive introduction → shadow dual-check → cutover →
  revert flag; widenings requiring approval listed>
Assumptions & open questions: <each with risk-if-wrong / who answers>
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Deny-by-default stated and structural: the matrix contains allows only;
      nothing is "allowed unless".
- [ ] Every tenant-owned resource has an object-level rule, not just an
      endpoint/role check.
- [ ] Every surface — including background jobs and integrations — appears in
      the enforcement-point map with an authoritative layer.
- [ ] Cross-tenant-capable platform roles are individually enumerated with
      audit requirements.
- [ ] Support/impersonation is grant-based, scoped, time-boxed, and audited.
- [ ] Every sensitive permission has at least one negative test; revoked and
      cross-tenant cases are covered.
- [ ] Role migrations are additive with shadow dual-check and a revert path;
      silent widenings: none.
- [ ] Authorization (role CAN) is not conflated with entitlement (plan
      INCLUDES) anywhere in the matrix.

## Security Rules

- Deny by default; an unlisted permission is a denied permission.
- UI hiding is never authorization; the authoritative check lives at or below
  the API/service layer, and the map says where.
- Object-level authorization is required for every tenant-owned resource —
  the IDOR class is designed out, not patched out.
- Every high-privilege grant, escalation, and impersonation use emits an
  audit event (schema via `audit-log-architect`).
- Negative tests are part of the design deliverable, not a QA afterthought.

## Tenant Isolation Rules

- Tenant roles never grant reach outside their tenant; role checks compose
  with tenant scoping (from `multi-tenant-data-architect`) — they do not
  replace it.
- Roles attach to memberships, so a user's power in tenant A says nothing
  about tenant B; revoking the membership revokes the role's effect
  everywhere, including active sessions and tokens (state the mechanism).
- Platform roles that cross tenants are the exception, enumerated and
  audited; "platform admin can do everything silently" is a finding.

## Gotchas

- Permission checks copy-pasted per handler drift within months; the matrix
  is only real if enforcement flows through a shared decision point.
- Role explosion ("billing-admin-readonly-eu") signals entitlement or scoping
  concerns leaking into roles — factor them back out to the right axis.
- Machine actors (API keys, service accounts) inheriting a human's role
  outlive the human's departure; they get their own rows in the matrix.
- Revocation is the forgotten path: removing a role/membership must be tested
  against live sessions, cached permissions, and issued tokens.
- The admin console tends to grow checks of its own that bypass the shared
  decision point — it is a surface in the map like any other.

## Stop Conditions

- Tenant/membership model undefined → stop; `tenant-modeler` first — roles
  have nothing to attach to.
- A requested role or rule would cross the tenant boundary or widen an
  existing role's reach → `human-approval-boundary` with the blast radius
  before it enters the matrix.
- Business ambiguity about who should hold a sensitive permission → present
  options with consequences; do not assign sensitive defaults silently.
- Asked to implement the permission system in the same pass → separate,
  scoped implementation task; this skill delivers the design and tests plan.

## Supporting Files

- [references/authorization-matrix-template.md](references/authorization-matrix-template.md) —
  matrix and enforcement-map templates, permission naming convention, and the
  negative-test catalog (IDOR probes, revocation, impersonation expiry).
- `evals/evals.json` — trigger + behavior cases.
- `evals/trigger-evals.json` — discrimination against `audit-log-architect`,
  `api-event-architect` (access & events cluster) and the entitlement axis
  (`plan-entitlement-architect`).
