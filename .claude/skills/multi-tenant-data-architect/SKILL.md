name: multi-tenant-data-architect
description: Design the tenant-scoped data layer — choose and justify the scoping strategy per store (shared tables with tenant key, schema-per-tenant, database-per-tenant, or mixed), define the tenant-context propagation contract from request to query (server-derived, never client-supplied), map data ownership, handle shared/reference data, plan indexing and partitioning by tenant, and produce a tenant data migration plan with verification and rollback. Also outputs a data-layer isolation test matrix. Use when designing storage for a multi-tenant product, retrofitting tenant scoping onto existing tables, planning a tenant data migration/re-shard, or deciding where a new store (cache, search index, vector store) gets its tenant scoping. Do NOT use to define tenant semantics (tenant-modeler), to audit an existing system for leaks (tenant-isolation-reviewer), or to author/audit RLS policies — policy-level authoring and audit belong to the Phase 4 security pack.

# Multi-Tenant Data Architect

## Purpose

Produce a data-layer design where every byte of tenant data has a declared
scope, a declared owner, and a declared path for how tenant context reaches
the query that touches it. Deliverables: a per-store scoping decision with
tradeoffs, a tenant-context propagation contract, a data ownership map,
shared-data rules, a migration plan with verification and rollback, and a
data-layer isolation test matrix. The discipline: scoping is decided per
store, and tenant context is derived server-side — a design where the client
names the tenant is a leak with extra steps.

## Use When

- Use when: designing storage for a new multi-tenant product or feature.
- Use when: retrofitting tenant scoping onto existing single-tenant tables
  (the backfill-and-enforce problem).
- Use when: planning a tenant data migration — pooled→silo for a big tenant,
  re-shard, region move — or its rollback.
- Use when: a new store appears (cache, queue, search index, vector store,
  object storage) and needs its tenant-scoping decision.
- Do NOT use when: what a tenant IS remains undefined — `tenant-modeler`
  first; scoping an undefined boundary produces confident nonsense.
- Do NOT use when: auditing an existing system for cross-tenant leakage —
  `tenant-isolation-reviewer`.
- Do NOT use when: writing or auditing RLS policies themselves — that is the
  Phase 4 security pack's scope; this skill decides WHERE enforcement lives,
  not the policy SQL.
- Do NOT use when: the structural question has no tenancy axis — plain
  `architecture-designer`.

## Inputs to Inspect

1. The tenant model (tenant-modeler output): tenant definition, hierarchy,
   the level isolation is enforced at, lifecycle states with data postures.
2. Current stores and schemas: tables, indexes, existing tenant keys or their
   absence, ORMs/query layers in use.
3. Where tenant context currently lives in a request (session, token claim,
   middleware) and how queries are built (query builder, raw SQL, ORM
   default scopes).
4. Data volume facts: row counts by table, largest tenant's share, growth
   rate, retention requirements — skew drives partitioning and silo choices.
5. All secondary stores: caches, queues, search indexes, vector stores,
   object storage, analytics sinks — each needs a scoping decision, not just
   the primary database.
6. Compliance/residency constraints that force physical separation.

## Workflow

1. **Read the tenant model first.** Pin which level of the hierarchy is the
   scoping key. Undefined → stop, route to `tenant-modeler`.
2. **Inventory every store** — primary DB, caches, queues, indexes, vector
   stores, object storage, analytics sinks. The design covers all of them; a
   store without a scoping decision is a finding against the design.
3. **Choose the scoping strategy per store** using
   [references/scoping-strategy-tradeoffs.md](references/scoping-strategy-tradeoffs.md):
   pooled (tenant key + enforced scoping), schema-per-tenant,
   database-per-tenant, or mixed. Justify per store; a mixed answer is
   normal, an unjustified one is not.
4. **Define the tenant-context propagation contract**: tenant id is derived
   server-side from the authenticated principal, bound once per request/job,
   and carried explicitly to every query — named mechanism (middleware +
   scoped repository, ORM default scope, session variable). Client-supplied
   tenant ids on data paths are forbidden by contract.
5. **Map data ownership**: every table/store → one owning component; classify
   tables as tenant-owned (scoped), shared/reference (read-only to tenants),
   or platform (control-plane; no tenant business data). Flag anything that
   doesn't classify cleanly.
6. **Design indexes and partitioning around the tenant key** — tenant key
   leading in composite indexes on tenant-owned tables; partitioning only
   with a stated size/skew number driving it.
7. **Wire lifecycle hooks**: for each tenant lifecycle state (suspend,
   offboard, purge), state what happens in each store — frozen, exported,
   deleted — and which jobs do it. Purge must enumerate every store,
   including backups' retention window.
8. **Write the migration plan** (new scoping or re-shard): expand → backfill
   → verify (per-tenant row counts and checksums) → enforce → contract, each
   step shippable and reversible; rollback defined per step, and no step's
   rollback may require un-running a backfill (keep old columns/paths until
   the contract step).
9. **Emit the data-layer isolation test matrix**: per store × operation,
   the negative expectation (tenant A's context cannot read/write tenant B's
   rows/objects/entries), handed to `tenant-isolation-reviewer` and QA.

## Output Format

Data ownership map: <table/store → owner → tenant-owned/shared/platform>
Indexing & partitioning: <tenant-key-leading indexes; partitioning + the

Lifecycle hooks: <state → per-store action → executing job>
Migration plan: <expand → backfill → verify → enforce → contract; rollback
  per step; verification = per-tenant counts/checksums>
Isolation test matrix (data layer): <store × operation × expected denial>
Assumptions & open questions: <each with risk-if-wrong / who answers>

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Every store in the inventory has a scoping decision — including caches,
      indexes, vector stores, and object storage.
- [ ] The propagation contract derives tenant context server-side and names
      the concrete mechanism; no data path trusts a client-supplied tenant id.
- [ ] Every table/store classified tenant-owned / shared / platform; every
      one has exactly one owner.
- [ ] Purge enumerates every store where the tenant's data exists, backups
      included.
- [ ] Migration steps are individually shippable with per-step rollback and
      count/checksum verification; enforcement flips only after verification.
- [ ] The isolation test matrix covers every store, not just the primary DB.
- [ ] No RLS policy SQL authored; enforcement location decided, policy
      authoring deferred to the Phase 4 pack.

## Tenant Isolation Rules

- Every tenant-owned table/entry/object carries the tenant scope key; scoping
  by joins-through-ownership alone is declared and justified where used.
- Tenant context is derived from the authenticated principal server-side —
  never from request bodies, query params, or file contents.
- Cross-tenant queries exist only in named, audited platform paths (support,
  billing aggregation, platform analytics), each listed in the design.
- Defense in depth is stated: application scoping plus database-level
  enforcement where available — the design names where each layer applies
  even though policy authoring is out of scope here.

## Gotchas

- The primary database gets all the attention while the cache serves tenant
  A's data to tenant B via an unscoped key — every store, every time.
- Backfilled tenant keys are wrong exactly where ownership was ambiguous;
  verify with per-tenant counts AND spot checksums before enforcing, not
  after.
- Tenant-key-last composite indexes make every scoped query a scan; the
  tenant key leads unless a measured query pattern says otherwise.
- Schema-per-tenant multiplies migrations by tenant count and drifts; it
  buys isolation optics, not automatic safety — the connection routing
  becomes the control.
- "Shared reference data" grows tenant-specific overrides within a quarter;
  design the override table now or inherit a fork later.
- Purge that forgets the search index, the vector store, or the analytics
  sink is a compliance incident with a delay timer.

## Stop Conditions

- Tenant model undefined or contested → stop; `tenant-modeler` (or
  `source-of-truth-reconciler`) first.
- Data volume/skew facts unknown AND they would flip pooled-vs-partitioned →
  ask for the numbers; do not design for imagined scale.
- The migration touches production data destructively (drops, rewrites) →
  `human-approval-boundary` before any executable step is specified.
- Residency/compliance requirements surface mid-design that force physical
  separation → re-run the scoping decision; do not bolt a region onto a
  pooled design.
- Asked to implement the migration in the same pass → separate, scoped task
  via `change-classification-gate`; this skill designs.
