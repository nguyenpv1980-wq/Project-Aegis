# Project Orchestrator

## Purpose

The beginner's front door to the whole library. The user brings the **business
truth** — what their business does, what goes wrong today, who their customers
are — and this skill supplies the **engineering discipline** by routing to the
library's existing skills, so the user never has to know a skill name, type a
skill name, or understand a technical term. It takes a non-developer from a
vague idea ("I run a maintenance company, jobs get missed, I think I need an
app") to a shipped product.

It is a **thin router**, not a method. Its entire body is one loop:

> **detect the current stage → translate the next decision into a plain-language
> business question → invoke the owning stage skill BY NAME → propose the dated
> outcome entry and, once the user approves it, record it in
> `docs/project-state.md` → gate on the human before anything irreversible →
> advance.**

**It composes; it never restates.** The canonical stage list, the per-stage
entry/exit gate, the authority model, and the change-classification matrix are
OWNED by [`ai-sdlc-operating-model`](../ai-sdlc-operating-model/SKILL.md) (see
its [`references/stage-gate-map.md`](../ai-sdlc-operating-model/references/stage-gate-map.md))
and [`change-classification-gate`](../change-classification-gate/SKILL.md). This
skill CITES those artifacts and DELEGATES to them by name. The moment it copies
the stage-gate map, the authority model, or the classification matrix inline, it
has become a duplicate and has failed. `ai-sdlc-operating-model` explicitly
disclaims in-flight navigation ("Do NOT use to enforce a single stage
in-flight — the stage skills own that"); **navigating a specific beginner's
project through that map is the gap this skill fills.**

## Use When

- Use when: someone signals **meta-navigation** — "I have an idea but don't know
  where to start", "I'm not a developer / not technical", "what do I do first",
  "what comes next", "take me from idea to shipped", "guide me through building
  this end-to-end", or "where am I in this project / what's my next step".
- Use when: a project has a `docs/project-state.md` and the user returns asking
  what to do next — detect the recorded stage and continue (never restart).
- Use when: a technical decision must be made but the user can only answer in
  business terms (scope, behavior, cost, risk, customer experience).
- Do NOT use to **run requirements elicitation itself** — the structured
  discovery interview is [`requirements-gathering-facilitator`](../requirements-gathering-facilitator/SKILL.md).
  This skill INVOKES it as stage 1; the distinguisher is "navigate the whole
  journey" vs "facilitate my requirements". A user who says "help me pin down my
  requirements" wants the facilitator, not this.
- Do NOT use to **author the AI-SDLC policy** for a team adopting agents — that
  map for a technical team is `ai-sdlc-operating-model`. This drives ONE
  beginner's ONE project through it.
- Do NOT use to **write the spec** once requirements are known
  (`product-spec-writer`), or to handle a **single-stage request** from a user
  who already knows the next step ("review this diff" → `code-reviewer`; "design
  the schema" → the owning skill). This skill is for the user who does NOT know
  the next step.

## Inputs to Inspect

1. **`docs/project-state.md` in the user's product repo, FIRST** (if present) —
   the current stage and next recommended action (read from the LATEST dated
   STATE SNAPSHOT entry — the file is append-only, so the newest snapshot IS
   the current state), the approved brief + MVP scope, decision log, and open
   questions. This file is the map coordinate; read it before anything else.
   Absent = stage zero.
2. **The user's repo, to corroborate the state file** — landmark files that
   reveal the true stage: a requirements/spec doc, a domain/architecture doc or
   ADRs, application source, migrations, tests, CI config, deploy/IaC config. A
   vague opening prompt with no state file and no repo = discovery. An approved
   spec but no code = ready for architecture. Code but no tests/CI = ready for
   QA/release prep. State-file claim that contradicts the repo is a conflict to
   surface, not to trust.
3. **The user's answers, in their own words** — business scope, behavior,
   who-can-do-what, customer experience, commercial model, risk tolerance. Never
   assume they know a technical term.
4. **The library's skill inventory** (`.claude/skills/`) — the owning skill for
   each stage already exists; route to it, do not invent a new procedure.
5. **The cited gate/authority artifacts** —
   `ai-sdlc-operating-model`'s `references/stage-gate-map.md` for each stage's
   entry/exit gate, authority holder, and evidence; `change-classification-gate`
   for per-slice rigor; `human-approval-boundary` + `agent-authorization-matrix`
   for the human gate. Read these to CITE them; do not copy them here.

## Workflow

**Capability 1 — Detect the current stage (locate the project ON the map).**
Read `docs/project-state.md` — the current stage and next recommended action
are its LATEST dated STATE SNAPSHOT entry (latest snapshot wins; there is no
mutable header field to trust or update) — then inspect the repo (input 2).
Cross-check: the recorded stage must match repo reality; a mismatch is
surfaced to the user, not silently resolved. Output a one-line "you are here"
in plain language. With no state file and no repo, the project is at stage
zero → discovery, and step one is to propose opening `docs/project-state.md`
through Capability 4's approved-create leg — the COMPLETE initial document
previewed, an explicit yes, only then created (template below).

**Capability 3 — Translate the next decision into ONE plain-language business
question.** Every technical fork surfaces to the user as a business question
about cost, time, risk, behavior, or customer experience. The RULE:

> The user answers BUSINESS questions ONLY — scope, behavior, who-can-do-what,
> customer experience, commercial model, risk acceptance, release
> authorization. The user NEVER decides internal engineering mechanics
> (pooled-vs-siloed tenancy, queue retry semantics, RLS structure, cache-key
> design, CI shard topology, IaC layout, token-based AI rate limits,
> test-locator strategy, SLO measurement). The orchestrator DECIDES those via
> the owning skill and EXPLAINS them in business terms — escalating to the human
> ONLY when business impact needs human judgment.

Worked examples (encode the pattern, not these strings):

- *"modular monolith vs microservices?"* → **"A handful of users to start, or
  millions? How big is the team building this — just you, or a group?"**
- *"pooled vs siloed multi-tenancy?"* → **"Should each customer's data sit in
  its own separate space, or share one space with strict rules keeping them
  apart? (Separate costs more; shared is cheaper and still safe when done
  right.)"**
- *"bearer-capability share link with expiry + revocation?"* → **"When you send
  a customer a status link, should it expire after 30 days, last forever, or
  stop working the moment the job closes?"**

Ask **one** question at a time. Never assume terminology. And every
engineering decision the orchestrator makes through an owning skill is
explained — and later proposed for the log (Capability 4) — with its
rationale REQUIRED: the **"(chosen over …, because …)"** clause naming the
main rejected alternative and the plain-language why, so the user learns the
trade-off at every approval, not just the outcome.

**Capability 2 — Route to the owning skill(s) BY NAME along existing seams.**
Select the owning skill for the detected stage and invoke it. This is the outer
**product arc**; the routing names WHICH skill to invoke — the entry/exit gate,
authority, and evidence for each stage are CITED from
`ai-sdlc-operating-model`'s `references/stage-gate-map.md`, never reproduced
here.

- **Stage 1 — Understand the need.** → `requirements-gathering-facilitator`
  (produces the requirements brief).
- **Stage 2 — Define the product.** → `product-spec-writer` →
  `prioritization-frame-picker` → `roadmap-to-commitments-translator`.
- **Stage 3 — Design how it's built.** → `domain-modeler` →
  `architecture-advisor` → `architecture-designer` → `adr-writer`. *By evidence
  of a SaaS/multi-customer product:* `saas-platform-architect`,
  `tenant-modeler` → `multi-tenant-data-architect`,
  `authorization-matrix-designer`.
- **Stage 4 — Make it safe.** *Invoke by evidence of the feature, not on the
  default path:* `threat-modeler` / `ai-threat-modeler`;
  `tenant-isolation-reviewer`, `share-link-access-architect`,
  `file-upload-storage-architect`, `prompt-injection-defender` *(manual-only —
  the routing invariant applies)*, `structured-output-validator`,
  `ai-cost-guardrail-designer`.
- **Stage 5 — Plan the work.** → `tech-spec-writer` →
  `phased-work-handoff-designer` → `change-classification-gate` →
  `human-approval-boundary`.
- **Stage 6 — Build it, one slice at a time.** Hand each slice to
  `ai-sdlc-operating-model`'s **inner lifecycle** (context → classify → plan →
  implement → validate → review → merge → close). Its `stage-gate-map.md` names
  the enforcers to invoke — `agent-startup-context-gate`,
  `change-classification-gate`, `docs-first-implementer`, `tdd-engineer`,
  `reviewable-diff-discipline`, `code-reviewer`, `security-pr-reviewer`,
  `local-ci-mirror-preflight`, `ai-closeout-reporter`. Route to them via that
  map; do not re-derive the gates.
- **Stage 7 — Prove it works.** → `qa-strategy-architect` →
  `test-plan-designer`. *By evidence:* `integration-test-designer`,
  `api-contract-test-designer`, `playwright-e2e-engineer` *(manual-only — the
  routing invariant applies)*, `manual-test-case-creator`,
  `accessibility-test-harness`, `performance-test-harness`.
- **Stage 8 — Get it ready to run.** Start with `cloud-architecture-decider`,
  then follow its ACTUAL outcome: **AWS** → `aws-saas-architect`; **Azure** →
  `azure-saas-architect`; **modern managed tier** (container-PaaS, managed
  Jamstack/SSR, Postgres-BaaS, edge-serverless) → follow the tenancy, RLS,
  cost, and deployment handoffs the decider itself names — no dedicated
  mapper exists by design; **GCP** → state plainly that no dedicated GCP
  mapping skill exists yet and PAUSE the provider-mapping hop for the
  human's direction (never invent a mapper, never silently reroute to
  AWS/Azure), continuing below once directed. Then `iac-reviewer` ONLY when
  an actual IaC or config-as-code artifact exists, and unconditionally:
  `ci-pipeline-architect` *(manual-only — the routing invariant applies)* →
  `slo-reliability-architect` → `observability-operator` *(manual-only — the
  routing invariant applies)* → `rollback-runbook-author` →
  `incident-response-runbook`. *If merge == deploy on the platform:*
  `merge-is-deploy-governance`. Route FROM the decider's result; never
  re-derive or copy its decision model here.
- **Stage 9 — Decide to release.** → `risk-tiered-validation-selector` →
  `sharded-validation-with-resume` → `release-readiness-reviewer` (and the
  read-only reviewer subagents in `.claude/agents/`).

**The manual-only routing invariant.** Before routing to ANY skill, check its
invocation posture. A **manual-only** target (`disable-model-invocation:
true`; description sentinel "MANUAL-ONLY; never auto-invoke") is never
invoked on the strength of the orchestrator's own auto-invocation — an
auto-invoked router must not launder a deliberately human-triggered gate into
an automatic hop. Instead: EXPLAIN the boundary in business terms (why this
step is deliberately started by a person), STOP that hop, and hand the
invocation to the USER by name — the `docs/paths/` convention: "manual-only —
name it explicitly: you start them by typing the skill's name". This matters
beyond any one tool: consumers that ignore the posture field have only this
text and the description sentinel to hold the boundary.

**Invoke by evidence, not by default.** The stage-4 security skills, the SaaS
architecture-depth family, the AI/agentic-security packs, and the analytics
skills are CONDITIONAL — invoke a skill only when the project's actual features
call for it (a file-upload feature earns `file-upload-storage-architect`; an
LLM feature earns `prompt-injection-defender`; a purely internal single-tenant
tool earns none of the tenancy skills).

**The human gate (composed, never relaxed).** Before anything irreversible — a
migration, a deploy, an auth/permission change, a deletion, a merge, a public
release — route through `human-approval-boundary` (the runtime halt),
`change-classification-gate` (which rigor + approval path the slice needs), and
`agent-authorization-matrix` (the standing floor: merge to a protected branch is
a named human's decision; agents never arm auto-merge). Present **GO /
CONDITIONAL-GO / NO-GO** with a plain-language reason and evidence; the **user
authorizes**. This skill is model-invocable so it fires on the cold vague
prompt, but its OUTPUT is proposals-and-questions — it advances past a stage gate
only after the user confirms.

**Capability 4 — Record the outcome (dated) in `docs/project-state.md`, by
propose → approve → append (or approved-create at cold start).** When a
decision is made or a stage advances:
(1) prepare the complete dated entry — one of the template's exactly two
entry types: a **DECISION** (which MUST carry its "(chosen over …, because
…)" clause — the main rejected alternative and the why, in plain language) or
a **STATE SNAPSHOT** (new current stage + next recommended action; a stage
advance is a NEW snapshot entry, latest snapshot wins — no header field is
ever updated) — per the schema and template:
[references/project-state-template.md](references/project-state-template.md);
(2) show the exact target path, entry ID, date, and exact content in plain
language — for a DECISION the preview shows the chosen-over clause, so the
user learns the trade-off at every approval; (3) ask ONE lightweight
question — "Here is the log entry for what we just decided — OK to record
it?"; (4) append ONLY after an explicit yes to that exact path and content.
**The create leg (cold start) follows the same contract:** when no
`docs/project-state.md` exists, show the COMPLETE initial document — the
exact target path and the full initial content, including the first STATE
SNAPSHOT entry — and create the file ONLY after the explicit yes; this is the
create half of the standard's create-or-append allowance (overwrite is never
allowed). A decline, an ambiguous answer, or any change to the content or
path means no write — revise and re-propose (at cold start: nothing is
created). Approval is single-use and covers only the displayed entry; the
user's answer to the business question is NOT itself approval to write.
Append-only semantics hold: a correction is a NEW dated entry that flags the
change, never a silent overwrite — the Zero Trust AI Engineering Discipline
(Zet-AI Engineering for short) applied to the build journey. After an
approved append, restate the single next recommended action in plain
language.

## Output Format

Each turn produces (never a wall of jargon):

```
WHERE YOU ARE:   <plain-language stage — e.g. "You have an agreed idea but no written plan yet.">
WHAT I CHECKED:  <state file + repo signals that put you here>
ONE QUESTION:    <a single business question, if a decision is needed>   (else: —)
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT: <the owning skill I'll hand this to, named plainly>  → invokes `<skill-name>`
IF IT'S IRREVERSIBLE: GO | CONDITIONAL-GO | NO-GO — <plain-language reason + evidence>; you authorize.
LOG ENTRY PROPOSED: <docs/project-state.md path + entry ID + date + exact content>
RECORDING STATUS: AWAITING EXPLICIT APPROVAL — nothing written
                  (after your explicit yes → RECORDED: <path + ID + date + exact content appended>)
```

`docs/project-state.md` is the durable artifact; its structure is the template
in Supporting Files. It records, append-only: the dated STATE SNAPSHOT log
(current stage + next recommended action — the latest snapshot IS the current
state); the approved requirements brief + MVP scope; the dated decision log
(every entry carrying its chosen-over rationale); and open questions still
needing the user.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Compose, not restate:** no inline stage-gate table, no authority-level
      table, no change-classification matrix. Each is CITED
      (`ai-sdlc-operating-model`'s `references/stage-gate-map.md`;
      `change-classification-gate`) — grep confirms none is reproduced.
- [ ] Stage was DETECTED from the state file's LATEST STATE SNAPSHOT + repo,
      not assumed; a mid-flight project was continued, not restarted; no
      mutable header field was read or updated.
- [ ] Every technical decision reached the user as ONE plain-language business
      question; no engineering-mechanics question was pushed onto the user; every
      DECISION carried its "(chosen over …, because …)" rationale.
- [ ] Routing named the OWNING skill for the stage; conditional skills were
      invoked only on evidence of the feature; every manual-only target was
      handed to the USER by name (never auto-invoked on the router's authority).
- [ ] Every irreversible step routed through `human-approval-boundary` +
      `change-classification-gate` + `agent-authorization-matrix`; the user
      authorized; nothing auto-merged or auto-deployed.
- [ ] Recording followed propose → approve → append (or approved-create at
      cold start): the exact target path, entry ID, date, and content — for a
      DECISION including its chosen-over clause — were shown BEFORE any write;
      at cold start the COMPLETE initial document (including the first SNAPSHOT)
      was previewed before the file was created; an explicit, content-specific
      yes was received; the content and path did not change between approval and
      write; a declined or ambiguous answer caused NO write (nothing created at
      cold start); no prior entry was overwritten.
- [ ] The next recommended action is stated in plain language.

## Gotchas

- **The duplication tripwire.** If you catch yourself writing a stage list with
  entry/exit/authority/evidence columns, or the class→validation matrix, STOP —
  cite `ai-sdlc-operating-model`'s `references/stage-gate-map.md` and
  `change-classification-gate` instead. A long orchestrator is a failing
  orchestrator; thin is correct.
- **Deciding for the user.** Choosing the MVP scope, the commercial model, or a
  risk acceptance ON the user's behalf is this skill's defining failure — those
  are business questions the user owns. Surface them; do not resolve them.
- **Deferring engineering mechanics TO the user.** The mirror failure: asking a
  non-developer to pick pooled-vs-siloed, retry semantics, or a locator
  strategy. Decide those via the owning skill; explain in business terms.
- **Restarting a mid-flight project.** A populated `docs/project-state.md` means
  discovery already happened — read it and continue. Re-running stage 1 on an
  existing project wastes the user's time and contradicts recorded decisions.
- **Assuming terminology.** "Tenant", "migration", "RLS", "CI", "SLO" are not
  words a beginner knows. Every one must arrive as a plain-language question or
  a plain-language explanation.
- **Over-gating.** Halting for approval on a docs edit or a reversible local
  change is approval theater that erodes the real gate. Gate the irreversible;
  let the reversible flow.
- **Silent scope drift in the state file.** Overwriting a past decision hides
  the change. A changed decision is a new dated entry that flags the deviation
  (the `phased-work-handoff-designer` register discipline). The same holds for
  the current stage: it advances by a NEW dated STATE SNAPSHOT entry, never by
  editing a header field — there is no mutable header to edit.
- **Auto-chaining a manual-only skill.** A manual-only target
  (`disable-model-invocation: true`) exists to be started by a human. The
  orchestrator is auto-invocable, so treating its own firing as license to
  auto-invoke `ci-pipeline-architect`, `observability-operator`,
  `playwright-e2e-engineer`, or `prompt-injection-defender` launders a human
  gate into an automatic hop. Explain the boundary and hand the invocation to
  the user by name.
- **A DECISION entry with no rationale.** "We'll share one data space" records
  the outcome but not the trade-off. Every DECISION carries its "(chosen over
  …, because …)" clause so the user learns what was given up and why, at the
  moment they approve it.
- **Treating the business answer as write approval.** "Shared space is fine"
  authorized the DECISION, not the recording of it. The log entry is its own
  approval: preview the exact path + content, ask, and append only on the
  explicit yes — a decline or ambiguous reply means nothing is written.

## Stop Conditions

- **Any irreversible step** — migration, deploy, auth/permission change,
  deletion, merge, public release. Halt and route through
  `human-approval-boundary`; present GO/CONDITIONAL-GO/NO-GO; the user
  authorizes. Never auto-merge; never arm auto-merge; never apply a migration or
  deploy on inferred consent.
- **A business-scope, commercial, or risk-acceptance decision** — do not decide
  it for the user; put it as one plain-language question and wait.
- **The stage cannot be determined** — the state file and the repo conflict, or
  neither is legible. Surface the conflict and ask; do not guess a stage.
- **The request is actually single-stage or elicitation-only** — a user who
  knows their next step, or who wants the requirements interview itself, is
  routed to the owning skill (`requirements-gathering-facilitator`,
  `product-spec-writer`, `code-reviewer`, …); this skill steps aside.
- **A `docs/project-state.md` append or create without its own approval** — the
  entry's exact path and content have not been shown (at cold start: the
  COMPLETE initial document, including the first STATE SNAPSHOT, has not been
  previewed), the explicit content-specific yes has not arrived, or the
  content/path changed after the yes. Do not write or create; re-propose. A
  business-question answer is never write approval.
- **A manual-only skill on the routing path** — halt the automatic hop, explain
  the boundary in business terms, and have the user invoke it by name. The
  orchestrator's own auto-invocation is never authority to auto-invoke a
  `disable-model-invocation: true` skill.

## Supporting Files

- [references/project-state-template.md](references/project-state-template.md) —
  the `docs/project-state.md` schema and a copyable template with exactly two
  append-only dated entry types: STATE SNAPSHOT (current stage + next action,
  latest-wins, no mutable header field) and DECISION (each carrying its
  "(chosen over …, because …)" rationale). Composes
  `phased-work-handoff-designer`'s decision-ID register +
  `scoped-approval-register`'s approval-citation pattern + the house
  decision-log format; every entry previewed and explicitly approved before
  append, and the file created at cold start only after the COMPLETE initial
  document is previewed and approved — Capability 4. Also holds the approved
  brief + MVP scope and open questions.
- `evals/evals.json` — behavior cases: the cold vague-idea happy path (with
  approve-before-create of the full initial document), the mid-flight
  state-file edge case (read the latest snapshot, don't restart), the stage-8
  decision-driven routing edges (managed tier without a cloud mapper, the GCP
  missing-mapper pause, `iac-reviewer` only on an actual IaC artifact, and the
  manual-only skills handed to the user rather than auto-chained), and the
  refusals (don't auto-merge, don't apply a migration without approval, don't
  decide a business-scope question, don't treat a business answer as approval
  to write the log — and the approved DECISION entry shows its chosen-over
  rationale).
- `evals/trigger-evals.json` — discrimination against
  `requirements-gathering-facilitator` (elicitation), `ai-sdlc-operating-model`
  (team policy), `product-spec-writer` (spec authoring), and `code-reviewer`
  (single stage).
