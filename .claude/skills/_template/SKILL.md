# _template (reference skill)

> **This is a template, not a shipped skill.** It lives at `.claude/skills/_template/`
> and is deliberately ignored by `scripts/validate-skills.py`. Do not invoke it.
> To create a skill: copy this directory, rename it, and fill in every section below.
> Full rules: [docs/skill-generation-standard.md](../../../docs/skill-generation-standard.md).

## Purpose

State, in one paragraph, what the real skill produces and the value it delivers.
Example: "Produces a normalized spreadsheet and summary tab from a messy export."

## Use When

- Use when: the user's request matches the concrete trigger the skill is built for.
- Use when: an adjacent-but-in-scope variation of that request appears.
- Do NOT use when: the request looks similar but belongs to another skill or a
  plain response — name that case explicitly so the model doesn't over-trigger.

## Inputs to Inspect

- The repo files, docs, code, tests, and prior artifacts the real skill must read
  before acting. List them concretely so context precedes action.

## Workflow

1. Gather and validate the inputs the skill needs (see **Inputs to Inspect**).
2. Perform the core transformation, reading `references/` detail files on demand.
3. Produce the deliverable exactly as specified in **Output Format**.
4. Run the **Validation Checklist** before declaring done.

## Output Format

Describe the exact deliverable: file path(s) and naming, report structure, or data
schema. Be specific enough that two runs produce consistent shapes.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Output matches the shape declared above.
- [ ] No **Stop Conditions** were silently bypassed.
- [ ] Any side-effecting step was gated behind explicit human confirmation.

## Gotchas

- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines; push detail into `references/`.
- Keep the frontmatter `description` trigger-oriented and under 1024 chars.
- Directory name and frontmatter `name` must stay identical.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and ask if required input is missing or the request is ambiguous.
- Stop and confirm before any irreversible or destructive action (delete, deploy,
  overwrite, spend).

## Supporting Files

- `evals/evals.json` — required for every real skill; see the copy in this template
  directory and [docs/templates/evals-template.json](../../../docs/templates/evals-template.json).
- `evals/trigger-evals.json` — add when the skill's trigger overlaps another skill.
- `references/`, `assets/`, `scripts/` — add only when they reduce errors (progressive
  disclosure). Use "None" here if the skill is self-contained.
