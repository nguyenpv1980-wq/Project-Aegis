name: agent-authorization-matrix
description: MANUAL-ONLY; never auto-invoke. Define the standing authorization matrix for AI agents — which actions an agent may take autonomously (read, plan, edit, test, commit, push feature branches, open PRs) and which ALWAYS require a named human decision (merging to protected branches, arming auto-merge — never agent-armed, deploys, releases, production data, secrets, history rewrites) — in a deny-by-default action × context matrix with approval scope/expiry semantics; the policy human-approval-boundary enforces at runtime. Invoke explicitly when deciding what an agent may do without asking, when granting or revoking authority, after an autonomy incident (e.g. a PR merged with no human review because auto-merge was armed), or to write a repo's agent-permissions policy. Proposal-first, artifacts edited after approval; the matrix steers every future agent run. Do NOT use for end-user or tenant roles and permissions (authorization-matrix-designer) or to halt an imminent risky step mid-task (human-approval-boundary).

# Agent Authorization Matrix

## Purpose

Make agent authority explicit instead of inferred. This skill produces the
standing, deny-by-default matrix of what an AI agent may do on its own
authority, what requires a named human decision, and what is forbidden — per
action class and execution context. It is the governance control for merge and
deploy authority: `human-approval-boundary` halts at a boundary in-flight; this
matrix IS the boundary definition it enforces. Its non-negotiable floor exists
because of a real incident class: auto-merge armed in one session fired in a
later one, merging a security-relevant PR with zero human review.

## Use When

- Use when (explicitly invoked by a human): defining or revising what an agent
  may plan, edit, test, commit, push, PR, merge, or deploy without further
  approval — for a repo, team, or agent fleet.
- Use when: granting or revoking a specific agent authority, or onboarding
  agents to a repo that has no written permission policy.
- Use when: after an autonomy incident — an agent merged, deployed, or
  destroyed something nobody approved — to codify the corrected authority.
- Do NOT use when: a risky action is imminent mid-task — that halt is
  `human-approval-boundary` (it enforces this matrix; it does not define it).
- Do NOT use when: designing roles × permissions for end users or tenants of a
  product — that is `authorization-matrix-designer`. This skill governs the
  AGENTS building the product, not the product's users.
- Do NOT use when: defining the overall workflow stages — that is
  `ai-sdlc-operating-model`, which cites this matrix for its authority column.
- Never auto-invoked: the matrix is a behavior-steering governance artifact —
  supply-chain-sensitive, human-initiated only (`disable-model-invocation: true`).

## Inputs to Inspect

1. Branch protection and merge settings: required reviews and checks, who may
   merge, whether auto-merge is enabled repo-wide
   (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}` → `allow_auto_merge`, branch protection).
2. Existing permission statements scattered across `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
   contribution docs, and any auto-merge policy doc — the fragments the matrix
   consolidates.
3. Incident history: every past case of an agent exceeding intended authority,
   and which missing rule allowed it.
4. Deploy/release pipelines: what a push, tag, or merge actually triggers —
   a "commit" that auto-deploys is a deploy authority question, not a commit.
5. The agent surfaces in use (CLI sessions, CI bots, scheduled agents) — each
   context the matrix must cover.
6. An existing matrix, if any: this run revises it, never forks a second one.

## Workflow

1. **Inventory agent-reachable actions** using the taxonomy in
   [references/matrix-template.md](references/matrix-template.md): read/plan,
   edit, test, commit, push (feature branch), open PR, comment/review, merge,
   arm/disarm auto-merge, tag/release, deploy, production data, secrets,
   memory and instruction-file edits, history rewrites.
2. **Inventory contexts:** scratch/worktree, feature branch, protected branch,
   CI, staging, production. A cell is action × context.
3. **Fill the matrix deny-by-default.** Every cell gets AUTONOMOUS,
   APPROVAL-REQUIRED, or FORBIDDEN plus a one-line rationale. Any action not
   listed is APPROVAL-REQUIRED by definition.
4. **Apply the non-negotiable floor** (weakening any of these requires an
   explicit, recorded human decision in the artifact itself):
   - Merging to a protected branch: APPROVAL-REQUIRED, always. The agent's
     terminal action is open-PR-and-STOP.
   - Arming auto-merge: FORBIDDEN for agents. Arming is merge authority
     exercised early — it outlives the session and fires on future green CI.
     Agents also RE-CHECK for armed auto-merge on their PRs after every push
     (`gh pr view <n> --json autoMergeRequest`) and treat an armed state not
     traceable to a recorded human decision as a hazard: disarm and flag.
   - Deploys, production data, secrets, history rewrites: APPROVAL-REQUIRED.
5. **Define approval semantics:** one-time vs durable, exact scope wording,
   expiry, and where approvals are recorded — composing the scope rules of
   `human-approval-boundary`, not redefining them.
6. **Propose the artifact** (location per repo convention, e.g.
   `docs/governance/agent-authorization-matrix.md`), including how the matrix
   itself is protected from agent self-modification. **STOP for approval.**
7. **Apply after approval** — exactly the approved matrix, nothing more; set a
   review date; record the approving human in the artifact.

## Output Format

```
AGENT AUTHORIZATION MATRIX
Scope:      <repo / team / fleet>   Approved by: <human>   Review: <date>
Matrix:     <action × context → AUTONOMOUS | APPROVAL-REQUIRED | FORBIDDEN, rationale>
Floor:      <the non-negotiable rows, stated in full>
Approvals:  <one-time vs durable semantics, recording location>
Self-protection: <how agents are prevented from editing this artifact silently>
Status:     AWAITING APPROVAL | APPLIED (approved by <human>, <date>)
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Deny-by-default holds: unlisted action = APPROVAL-REQUIRED.
- [ ] Merge-to-protected, arm-auto-merge, deploy, prod-data, secrets, and
      history-rewrite cells are human-gated or forbidden — no exceptions
      without a recorded human decision inside the artifact.
- [ ] Every AUTONOMOUS cell has a rationale; none granted by omission.
- [ ] Approval semantics (scope, durability, expiry, recording) are defined.
- [ ] No governance file edited before explicit approval.
- [ ] The matrix documents its own protection against agent self-modification.

## Gotchas

- Auto-merge is the classic authority leak: armed while checks were red, it
  merges the moment CI goes green — in a later session, with nobody watching.
  The incident that motivated this skill merged a security PR to main exactly
  that way. Arming is therefore treated as the merge decision itself.
- CI green is validation, not authorization. A matrix cell must never read
  "AUTONOMOUS if checks pass" for merge-class actions.
- Approval of a plan is not approval of the merge; approval on staging is not
  approval on production. Durable approvals apply no wider than their wording.
- A "commit" that a pipeline auto-deploys is a deploy. Classify cells by what
  the action TRIGGERS, not what the git verb is called.
- A matrix agents can silently edit is self-granted authority; store it where
  changes are reviewed (protected path, gate-guard-style check).
- Over-restriction backfires: if agents need approval to run tests, humans
  start rubber-stamping, and the meaningful gates drown in noise.

## Stop Conditions

- Proposal complete → full stop until explicit human approval. Applying an
  unapproved authorization matrix is this skill's defining failure.
- Asked to grant agents autonomous merge, deploy, or auto-merge-arming
  authority → halt and route through `human-approval-boundary`; such a grant
  happens only as an explicit, recorded human decision written into the
  artifact with the accepted risk.
- An armed auto-merge or standing permission is discovered that no recorded
  human decision explains → halt, disarm/flag, and report before continuing.
- The matrix's storage location cannot be protected from silent agent edits →
  flag the gap and get an explicit decision before publishing the artifact.

## Supporting Files

- [references/matrix-template.md](references/matrix-template.md) — action
  taxonomy, context list, copyable matrix template with the default floor
  pre-filled, and the auto-merge incident case study.
- `evals/evals.json` — behavior cases, including the auto-merge incident
  (positive: open PR and stop; negative: never merge on own authority).
- `evals/trigger-evals.json` — discrimination against `human-approval-boundary`,
  `authorization-matrix-designer`, and the Phase 1.5 siblings.
