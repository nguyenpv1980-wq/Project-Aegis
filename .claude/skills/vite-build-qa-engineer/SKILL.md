description: MANUAL-ONLY; never auto-invoke. QA the Vite build itself — run the production build and PROVE no secret reached the client bundle (audit VITE_-prefixed env vars, grep dist output for secret values and patterns, check define/import.meta.env usage), verify build vs preview vs dev behavior parity (mode/env-file resolution, base path, asset and dynamic-import URLs), inspect bundle output (size budgets, unexpected inclusions, sourcemap policy for production), and validate preview serving of the built artifact including SPA fallback routing. Use when asked to verify a Vite build before deploy, audit VITE_ env vars or bundle contents for secret exposure, debug works-in-dev-but-not-in-build issues, or gate builds in CI with output checks. RUNS builds and preview servers. Do NOT use for moving secrets server-side and rotating leaked credentials (secrets-identity-hardener), unit/component testing (vitest-unit-component-engineer), E2E journeys (playwright-e2e-engineer), or CI pipeline design (qa-automation-architect).

# Vite Build QA Engineer

## Purpose

Verify the artifact that actually ships: run the production build, prove the
client bundle contains no secrets, confirm the built app behaves like the
dev app (modes, env files, base path, assets, routing), and inspect the
output against size and sourcemap policy. Dev-mode green tells you nothing
about the bundle — this skill tests the build product itself and reports
with real command output.

## Use When

- Use when: asked to verify/QA a Vite build before deploy or release.
- Use when: auditing `VITE_` env vars or checking whether a secret leaked
  into the client bundle.
- Use when: something works in `vite dev` but breaks built/previewed —
  mode/env resolution, base path, dynamic imports, SPA fallback.
- Use when: adding build-output checks (bundle budget, secret grep,
  sourcemap policy) that CI will run — implementing the checks; the CI
  pipeline design itself is `qa-automation-architect`.
- Do NOT use when: a secret IS confirmed in the bundle and must be moved
  server-side + rotated — that remediation is the shipped
  `secrets-identity-hardener` (manual-only); this skill detects and proves,
  then hands off.
- Do NOT use when: testing app logic/components — 
  `vitest-unit-component-engineer`; or journeys — `playwright-e2e-engineer`.
- Do NOT use when: designing the whole automation/CI architecture —
  `qa-automation-architect`.

## Inputs to Inspect

1. Vite config(s): `vite.config.*` — `envPrefix`, `define`, `base`, build
   options, plugins that inject values, sourcemap settings.
2. Env files and their mode mapping: `.env`, `.env.production`,
   `.env.staging`, `.env.*.local` — every `VITE_`-prefixed variable is
   PUBLIC by design; list them all.
3. Where env values enter code: `import.meta.env.*` usage, `define`
   replacements, runtime config endpoints.
4. Deployment intent: target base path/subdirectory, SPA vs MPA routing,
   hosting rewrite rules (affects preview parity checks).
5. Build scripts and CI: which commands/modes are actually used to produce
   the shipped artifact (test THAT mode, not just default production).

## Workflow

1. **Inventory the env surface.** List every `VITE_`-prefixed variable per
   mode and classify: safe-public (API base URLs, feature flags) vs
   secret-shaped (keys, tokens, connection strings, anything named
   *_SECRET/*_KEY with a private value). Secret-shaped `VITE_` vars are
   findings BEFORE the build even runs. Check `define` and plugin injection
   too — the prefix is not the only leak path.
2. **Run the real production build** with the mode(s) CI/deploy actually
   uses; record the exact command and output (warnings included — chunk
   size warnings, mixed-import warnings are findings to triage, not noise).
3. **Prove bundle cleanliness:** search `dist/` (JS, CSS, HTML, sourcemaps)
   for (a) the VALUES of known server-side secrets from the environment, (b)
   secret-shaped patterns, (c) each inventoried `VITE_` value to confirm
   what shipped. Absence is claimed only for what was actually searched —
   state the method. Recipes in
   [references/vite-build-checks.md](references/vite-build-checks.md).
4. **Verify build/preview parity:** serve with `vite preview` (or the real
   host emulation), walk the critical routes — direct-URL deep links (SPA
   fallback), asset/dynamic-import loading under the configured `base`,
   env-dependent behavior per mode. Works-in-dev-only issues get root-caused
   to the build semantics difference, not shrugged at.
5. **Inspect the output:** bundle sizes vs budget (or record the baseline if
   none exists), unexpected inclusions (server-only modules, dev tools,
   giant deps pulled into the entry chunk), sourcemap policy enforced
   (production maps per repo policy: absent, hidden, or uploaded-restricted).
6. **Report with evidence** and wire repeatable checks: the secret-grep and
   budget checks as scripts CI can run (placement per the automation
   blueprint). Confirmed secret exposure → stop wiring, hand to
   `secrets-identity-hardener` for relocation + rotation.

## Output Format

```
VITE BUILD QA — <app> @ <commit/build>
Env inventory: <VITE_ vars per mode → safe-public | SECRET-SHAPED (finding)>
Injection paths checked: <import.meta.env / define / plugins>
Build: <exact command + mode> → <result, warnings triaged>
Bundle cleanliness: <what was searched (values/patterns/files) → findings
                    or "none found by this method">
Parity checks: <route/asset/deep-link/mode results under preview + base>
Output inspection: <sizes vs budget, unexpected inclusions, sourcemap policy>
Findings: <severity-ranked, each with evidence (file in dist, matched value)>
CI checks wired: <scripts + placement, or handoff to automation blueprint>
Handoffs: <confirmed secrets → secrets-identity-hardener (relocate+rotate);
          app bugs → systematic-debugger>
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Every `VITE_` var per mode inventoried and classified; `define`/plugin
      injection paths checked too.
- [ ] Build run with the REAL deploy mode; command + output recorded.
- [ ] Bundle search covered values AND patterns, across JS/CSS/HTML/maps;
      method stated with the claim.
- [ ] Deep links, assets, and dynamic imports verified under the configured
      `base` via preview.
- [ ] Sourcemap policy for production verified, not assumed.
- [ ] Size budget compared or baseline recorded.
- [ ] Secret findings handed to `secrets-identity-hardener`, not "fixed" by
      renaming the variable here.

## Security Rules

- Any `VITE_`-prefixed variable is public the moment it's built — treat
  secret-shaped ones as exposures even if "only staging".
- A leaked secret found in `dist/` means the value is COMPROMISED wherever
  that artifact went — removal alone is not remediation; rotation is
  (`secrets-identity-hardener` owns it).
- Sourcemaps ship your source: production map policy is a security decision,
  verified per deploy target.

## Gotchas

- `import.meta.env` values are statically replaced at build time — grepping
  source tells you intent; only grepping `dist/` tells you truth.
- `.env.local`/`.env.[mode].local` differences make local builds diverge
  from CI builds — verify with the CI env source, not just the laptop.
- `base` misconfiguration breaks only nested-route refreshes and dynamic
  imports — the home page working proves nothing; test deep links.
- `vite preview` is not the production server: host rewrites, headers, and
  compression differ — parity here is necessary, not sufficient; say so in
  the report.
- Public API keys that are legitimately client-side (analytics IDs, some
  provider publishable keys) are not findings — classify by the provider's
  own public/secret designation, and say which designation was assumed.

## Stop Conditions

- The build fails for app-code reasons → report the failure output; fixing
  app code is a separate change (`systematic-debugger` / owner), not silent
  patching here.
- A confirmed secret is in a bundle that already shipped → escalate
  immediately (rotation urgency) via `secrets-identity-hardener` /
  `human-approval-boundary`; do not sit on it until the report is polished.
- The deploy mode/env source can't be determined → verifying the wrong mode
  produces false assurance; ask before claiming the artifact is clean.
- Asked to also restructure env handling across the codebase → that is
  `secrets-identity-hardener` scope; hand off.
