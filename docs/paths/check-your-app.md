# Check your app before you trust it

*This path names who acts and in what order — each skill owns its own how.*

**Who this is for:** you built something — maybe with AI writing most of the code — and you
want to know if it's safe before real users and real data depend on it. You don't need to
know what any of the skill names below mean; each one is a specialist that explains itself
when it runs.

**How to run it:** open your project in Claude Code and take the steps top to bottom. For
most steps, asking for what the step describes in plain words is enough — the named skill
selects itself. Two steps act on secrets, so they are deliberately never invoked
automatically: they are marked **manual-only — name it explicitly**, and you start them by
typing the skill's name.

Steps marked *"If…"* are conditional — skip them honestly when the condition doesn't apply
to your app.

## The order

1. **Map what was actually built —
   [`full-codebase-auditor`](../../.claude/skills/full-codebase-auditor/SKILL.md).**
   Yields an honest inventory of the codebase's real state, risks, and technical debt — the
   map every later step works from. Handoff: keep its risk list open; each step below picks
   up its findings.

2. **Stop the urgent leaks —
   [`secrets-identity-hardener`](../../.claude/skills/secrets-identity-hardener/SKILL.md)**
   *(manual-only — name it explicitly: it acts on secrets, so it never auto-fires).*
   Yields leaked and hardcoded credentials found, moved out of the code, and rotated — the
   bleeding-now class closed before anything slower. Handoff: any identity findings feed the
   isolation work in step 3.

   *If your app is built with Vite:* also name
   [`vite-build-qa-engineer`](../../.claude/skills/vite-build-qa-engineer/SKILL.md)
   *(manual-only — name it explicitly)*. Yields proof the shipped browser bundle itself is
   secret-free — what step 2 fixed in the source, this confirms in the artifact users
   actually download.

3. ***If your app has multiple users or customers*** *(most SaaS apps do)* — prove they
   can't see each other:

   - **Find every leak surface —
     [`tenant-isolation-reviewer`](../../.claude/skills/tenant-isolation-reviewer/SKILL.md).**
     Yields every place one customer's data could reach another. Handoff: its findings
     drive the two skills below.
   - **Audit and fix the database rules —
     [`rls-policy-auditor`](../../.claude/skills/rls-policy-auditor/SKILL.md).**
     Yields the row-security audit with the fix delivered as a reviewable migration.
   - **Make the fix un-regressable —
     [`multi-tenant-security-tester`](../../.claude/skills/multi-tenant-security-tester/SKILL.md).**
     Yields the isolation findings turned into an executable negative test suite, so a
     future change can't silently reopen the leak.

4. **Scan the whole repository —
   [`security-scan-orchestrator`](../../.claude/skills/security-scan-orchestrator/SKILL.md).**
   Yields one aggregated security-scan report across the codebase. Handoff: hand the report
   to [`static-analysis-reviewer`](../../.claude/skills/static-analysis-reviewer/SKILL.md),
   which yields the findings triaged into real-versus-noise, and to
   [`supply-chain-security-reviewer`](../../.claude/skills/supply-chain-security-reviewer/SKILL.md),
   which yields a judgment on the dependency tree your app inherited.

5. **Check what happens when it fails —
   [`error-handling-security-reviewer`](../../.claude/skills/error-handling-security-reviewer/SKILL.md).**
   Yields the fail-open paths — the catch-the-error-and-continue class AI-generated code
   loves — each one closed or explicitly accepted. Handoff: open items go on the step-7
   evidence list.

6. ***If your app has AI features*** *(a chatbot, an assistant, anything that calls a
   model)*: branch to **[Add AI features safely](add-ai-safely.md)** and run that path,
   then come back here for the close.

7. **The go/no-go —
   [`release-readiness-reviewer`](../../.claude/skills/release-readiness-reviewer/SKILL.md).**
   Yields an evidence-based GO / CONDITIONAL-GO / NO-GO on shipping, built from what the
   steps above actually found — not from anyone's assurance that it's probably fine. This
   is the close of the path.

## What this is — and isn't

This is a guided order, not a guarantee. Each skill's own output is the evidence: what it
found, what it fixed, what it left open. If a step reports findings you don't understand,
ask Claude Code to explain them in plain words before moving on — an unexplained finding is
not a cleared one.
