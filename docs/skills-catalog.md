# Project Aegis — Skills & Agents Catalog

Single source of truth for what skills and subagents exist, what is planned, and how the two
differ. The backlog below is derived from the **reconciled phase lists**
([`docs/reconciliation/step-0-reconciliation-v4.md`](reconciliation/step-0-reconciliation-v4.md) §3)
and the **category backlogs** under [`docs/skills/`](skills/). `scripts/validate-skills.py`
checks that every *implemented* skill is listed here and in `README.md`.

> **Status:** Phase 0 (foundation), Phase 1 (the 8-skill operating-discipline pack,
> decision D4), Phase 1.5 (the 4-skill AI-SDLC governance completion, roadmap
> #261/#268/#279/#280), Phase 2 (the 10-skill core architecture & engineering pack),
> Phase 3 (the 9-skill SaaS & tenant isolation pack), Phase 4 (the 9-skill
> security, RLS & supply-chain pack), Phase 5 (the 16-skill QA, E2E, manual QA
> & evidence pack — the 13 canonical skills plus 3 pulled forward from the QA
> backlog, roadmap #184/#185/#204), and Phase 6 (the 10-skill cloud, DevOps,
> reliability & release pack), Phase 7 (the 14-skill AI security &
> LLM systems pack — v4's 10 plus 4 OWASP LLM Top 10 gap additions, D6),
> Phase 7.5 (the 6-skill agentic AI security pack plus 3 extensions of
> existing skills — OWASP Agentic Top 10, D7), and the Compliance &
> Governance batch (the 9-skill ISO 27001 + ISO 42001 + SOC 2 pack with
> NIST AI RMF as companion — one shared control foundation, framework
> projections, and a crosswalk, D9) are implemented, plus the first pull
> from the D13 library-meta scope (`skill-quality-reviewer`, D18). `_template`
> remains a reference template ignored by the validator. Everything under
> "Backlog" is planned, not built.

## Skills vs. Agents

| | **Skill** (`.claude/skills/`) | **Subagent** (`.claude/agents/`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What it is | A reusable *procedure* — an ordered workflow Claude loads and executes. | A read-only *reviewer persona* spawned to judge a delimited task in its own context. |
| Invocation | Triggers on its `description`, or explicitly by name. | Delegated to via the Agent tool. |
| Tools | Inherits session tools; narrows via `allowed-tools`. | Declares its own tools; **read-only by default** (decision D2). |
| Best for | Repeatable transformations/generation with a defined output + evals. | Focused review/audit passes that benefit from isolation and a specialized lens. |
| Rule of thumb | If it *does* something and produces an artifact → skill. | If it *judges* something and returns findings → agent. |

Agents **compose** skills; they must not duplicate skill bodies. Role → subagent mapping is
in the reconciliation doc §5.

---

## Priority definitions

| Tier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **P0** | Foundation + operating discipline + core engineering/SaaS/security/QA that must exist before the library is trustworthy. Phases 0–5 skew P0. |
| **P1** | High-value packs that build on P0: cloud/DevOps/reliability and AI security (Phases 6–7), plus P1 items inside earlier phases. |
| **P2** | Remaining 300-roadmap breadth, generated in Phase 8 batches of ≤20 after P0/P1 prove the pattern. |

---

### Skills (Phase 1 — operating-discipline pack)

All under `.claude/skills/<name>/`; every one ships `evals/evals.json` (structural
convention, decision D3 — present and well-formed, not "passing").

| Skill | Roadmap ref (cat 08) | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent-startup-context-gate` | #262 | yes | Verify repo identity + load governing context before any work; halt when the location can't be verified. |
| `source-of-truth-reconciler` | #269 (+#270 assumption-surfacing) | yes | Resolve doc/code/instruction conflicts by evidence-cited precedence; surface all assumptions. |
| `change-classification-gate` | #264 (+#263 scope lock) | yes | Classify a change → validation floor + approval path; lock scope to the approved class. |
| `human-approval-boundary` | #265 (+#270 stop-when-unclear) | yes | Halt for explicit approval at high-risk boundaries with a structured approval request. |
| `reviewable-diff-discipline` | #271 (+#272 exact-file staging) | yes | Small intentional diffs; exact-path staging; staged set must equal declared intent. |
| `ai-closeout-reporter` | #274 | yes | Terminal closeout with a mandatory "intentionally not done / omitted" section. |
| `agent-failure-recovery` | #275 | **no** (manual-only; mutates git state) | Preserve-first recovery of broken git/tree state; destructive cleanup needs backup + approval. |
| `agent-instruction-consolidator` | #276 | **no** (manual-only; edits behavior-steering files) | Align agent instruction files to one canonical source with rule-preservation proof. |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for the two overlap clusters:
context/truth (`agent-startup-context-gate`, `source-of-truth-reconciler`) and
change governance (`change-classification-gate`, `human-approval-boundary`,
`reviewable-diff-discipline`).

### Skills (Phase 1.5 — AI-SDLC governance completion)

Completes the category-08 governance layer Phase 1 started (roadmap
#261/#268/#279/#280). These four COMPOSE the Phase 1 skills — each stage or
control cites its enforcing skill by name, never restating its procedure. All
ship `evals/evals.json` **and** `evals/trigger-evals.json` (the four overlap
each other and the Phase 1 pack). Two edit behavior-steering artifacts and are
**manual-only** (`disable-model-invocation: true`): `agent-authorization-matrix`
(governance artifacts) and `agent-memory-governance` (memory files).

| Skill | Roadmap ref (cat 08) | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ai-sdlc-operating-model` | #261 | yes | End-to-end human+agent lifecycle contract: named stages with entry/exit gates, per-stage authority (human / agent / agent-with-approval), enforcing skill per stage, failure routing, learning loop; grounded in observed PR practice with a gap list. |
| `agent-authorization-matrix` | #268 | **no** (manual-only; edits governance artifacts) | Deny-by-default action × context matrix of standing agent authority — merge to protected branches requires a named human always, auto-merge arming forbidden to agents (armed state re-checked after every push), approval scope/expiry semantics; proposal-first. |
| `agent-memory-governance` | #279 | **no** (manual-only; edits memory files) | Memory WRITE/TRUST/HYGIENE rules: confirmed durable facts with provenance and absolute dates, never secrets; remembered repo/PR state verified against live git/gh before acting; per-entry disposition-approved cleanups. |
| `agent-governance-audit` | #280 | yes | Per-control PASS/FAIL/UNVERIFIABLE compliance audit of one AI-assisted change from primary evidence (PR timeline incl. who armed auto-merge, commits, CI runs); closeout claims cross-checked, never trusted; missing evidence is never a PASS. |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for all four: the
governance cluster discriminates internally (umbrella vs matrix vs memory vs
audit) and against the Phase 1 pack (`human-approval-boundary`,
`source-of-truth-reconciler`, `agent-startup-context-gate`,
`agent-instruction-consolidator`, `ai-closeout-reporter`,
`change-classification-gate`), Phase 2's `code-reviewer` and
`full-codebase-auditor`, and Phase 3's `authorization-matrix-designer`
(agent authority vs end-user RBAC).

### Skills (Phase 2 — core architecture & engineering pack)

All under `.claude/skills/<name>/`; every one ships `evals/evals.json` **and**
`evals/trigger-evals.json` (all ten sit in one of three overlap clusters).

| Skill | Source (category doc) | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `domain-modeler` | cat 01 #3 (Domain Model Discovery) | yes | Domain model from requirements/code — language, contexts, aggregates + invariants; ends at a hard "do not code yet" gate. |
| `architecture-designer` | cat 01 #42/#55 | yes | Inspects CURRENT architecture first; component/dependency/data-ownership maps, tradeoffs, ADR draft, incremental migration plan. |
| `adr-writer` | cat 01 #1 (ADR Authoring) | yes | ADR with honest alternatives, consequences, operational impact, mandatory rollback/reversal plan + review date. |
| `docs-first-implementer` | cat 08 discipline (ex-`grill-with-docs`) | yes | Pin the EXACT installed version (lockfile), read matching docs, summarize task syntax, implement, verify; uncertainty declared, never guessed. |
| `tdd-engineer` | cat 06 | yes | Strict red-green-refactor; confirms each test fails for the INTENDED reason before implementing the minimal change; exact commands reported. |
| `systematic-debugger` | cat 06/08 | yes | Reproduce → reduce → isolate → fix ONE thing → verify → prevent; prediction-tested hypotheses, no shotgun fixes. |
| `code-reviewer` | cat 08 #277 (AI Code Review Protocol) | yes | Reviews ACTUAL diffs only; severity-ranked findings with file:line evidence + remediation; no diff, no review. |
| `code-simplifier` | cat 01 #11 adjacent | **no** (manual-only; edits working code) | Behavior-preserving simplification, green-before-and-after per move; coverage gate; "not done" list is a deliverable. |
| `principal-code-analyst` | cat 01 | yes | Subsystem strategic read: findings laddered to architecture/security/cost claims; risk register; small-step remediation + validation plan. |
| `full-codebase-auditor` | cat 06/08 #280 | yes | Whole-repo audit, inventory BEFORE findings; results filed as confirmed / likely / hypotheses / missing information; provable coverage. |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for the three Phase 2 clusters:
design (`domain-modeler`, `architecture-designer`, `adr-writer`), implementation
(`docs-first-implementer`, `tdd-engineer`, `systematic-debugger`), and review/audit
(`code-reviewer`, `code-simplifier`, `principal-code-analyst`, `full-codebase-auditor`).

> Namespace note (intended, see Phase 6 note below): `full-codebase-auditor` exists as
> both a **subagent** (`.claude/agents/`, the review lens) and this **skill**
> (`.claude/skills/`, the procedure). The agent composes the skill.

### Skills (Phase 3 — SaaS & tenant isolation pack)

All under `.claude/skills/<name>/`; every one ships `evals/evals.json` **and**
`evals/trigger-evals.json` (all nine sit in one of three overlap clusters). None has
side effects, so all are model-invocable. Per master-prompt §5: tenant isolation is
treated as cross-cutting (identity, data, API, storage, logs, analytics, support,
exports, imports, jobs, search, AI retrieval, billing, flags, audit), every skill
carries migration + rollback considerations, and the security-related skills require
negative tests.

| Skill | Source (category doc) | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `saas-platform-architect` | cat 02 (platform; #79/#84) | yes | Per-component pooled/siloed/bridge decisions with named isolation mechanisms; control-plane/data-plane split; capability inventory; rollout with per-step rollback. |
| `tenant-modeler` | cat 02 #56 | yes | Tenant semantics: definition + hierarchy, membership-as-entity (roles on membership), invitations, ownership, lifecycle state machine with per-state access/data/billing/jobs posture. |
| `tenant-isolation-reviewer` | cat 03 (isolation review) | yes | Reviews REAL systems for cross-tenant leakage across all 15 surfaces; evidence-cited findings, isolation test matrix, negative tests, honest not-inspected list. |
| `multi-tenant-data-architect` | cat 02 #74/#77/#78 + cat 04 | yes | Per-store scoping decisions (incl. caches/search/vector stores), server-derived tenant-context propagation contract, ownership map, expand→contract migration with verification + rollback. |
| `authorization-matrix-designer` | cat 02 #59 | yes | Deny-by-default roles × permissions × resources matrix, object-level rules (anti-IDOR), enforcement-point map, brokered support access, negative-test plan, additive role migration. |
| `plan-entitlement-architect` | cat 02 #60/#64 | yes | Plan × entitlement matrix with one resolution point, uniform enforcement everywhere, metering hooks, plan-transition table (no silent data loss on downgrade), grandfathering + rollback. |
| `audit-log-architect` | cat 02 #70 | yes | Audit event taxonomy + versioned record schema, append-only integrity, explicit write-failure policy per category, retention/redaction, tenant-scoped access, negative tests. |
| `saas-cost-architect` | cat 02 #89 | yes | Bill-grounded cost drivers, attribution-or-admission per driver, distribution-based unit economics vs revenue, exposure math, guardrails with observe-first rollout + rollback. |
| `api-event-architect` | cat 04 (API/event contracts) | yes | Credential-derived tenant context, idempotency, per-tenant/plan rate limits, versioning + deprecation with dual-run, tenant-scoped signed webhooks, contract migration + rollback. |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for the three Phase 3 clusters:
tenant (`tenant-modeler`, `tenant-isolation-reviewer`, `multi-tenant-data-architect`),
platform/commercial (`saas-platform-architect`, `plan-entitlement-architect`,
`saas-cost-architect`), and access & events (`authorization-matrix-designer`,
`audit-log-architect`, `api-event-architect`) — plus cross-cluster discrimination for
the authorization-vs-entitlement axis ("can this ROLE do X" vs "does this PLAN include X").

### Skills (Phase 4 — security, RLS & supply-chain pack)

All under `.claude/skills/<name>/`; every one ships `evals/evals.json` **and**
`evals/trigger-evals.json` (all nine sit in one of two overlap clusters). Per
master-prompt §6: ASVS-style verification, SSDF-style secure-SDLC, and SLSA-style
supply-chain thinking; scanner output is treated as input, not truth; high-severity
claims require an exploit path or abuse scenario; tenant isolation and object-level
authorization are mandatory on SaaS paths; every skill produces concrete artifacts and
negative tests; no finding is suppressed without written rationale. Two skills have
side effects and are **manual-only** (`disable-model-invocation: true`):
`appsec-implementer` and `secrets-identity-hardener` edit code/config.

Per reconciliation §3, the execution-plan `rls-policy-author` and
`rls-negative-test-designer` are **merged into `rls-policy-auditor`** (no separate
skills): it audits SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies, hunts recursion / unsafe
SECURITY DEFINER / broad grants / missing tenant scope / service-role leakage /
frontend-derived scope, authors corrected policies on request, and always ships a
per-command negative-test plan.

| Skill | Source (category doc) | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `threat-modeler` | cat 03 #91/#92 | yes | Design-time threat model: assets/actors/trust-boundaries, STRIDE per boundary, abuse cases, exploit-path-gated severity, mitigations mapped to negative tests; consumes tenant/authz outputs. |
| `appsec-implementer` | cat 03 (control implementation) | **no** (manual-only; edits code/config) | Builds one NAMED control test-first — negative test red→green, minimal server-side control, scoped diff, residual risk stated. |
| `multi-tenant-security-tester` | cat 03 #93/#95 + cat 06 | yes | Executable cross-tenant/authorization negative suite: two-tenant fixtures, forbidden-action-denied assertions, positive controls, IDOR/list/mass-assignment/exports/jobs, honest coverage. |
| `rls-policy-auditor` | cat 03 #94/#95/#96/#97/#98/#99/#100/#102 (merged author + negative-test designer) | yes | Per-command RLS audit/authoring: recursion, unsafe SECURITY DEFINER, broad grants, missing tenant scope, service-role leakage, frontend-derived scope; mandatory negative-test plan; delivers policies as a migration, never runs live DDL. |
| `secrets-identity-hardener` | cat 03 #103/#104/#123/#109 | **no** (manual-only; edits code/config) | Env classification (catches VITE_/NEXT_PUBLIC_ leaks), moves secrets server-side with a client-bundle-absence proof, rotates leaked creds, least-privilege service accounts, session/token flags. |
| `supply-chain-security-reviewer` | cat 03 #121/#122 | yes | SLSA-style: lockfile-based dependency set, reachability triage of scanner output, install/build-script and CI compromise paths, SHA pinning, compromise-path-gated severity. |
| `security-pr-reviewer` | cat 03 #114/#111/#112/#113 + cat 08 #277 | yes | Security lens on an ACTUAL diff: authz/object-level/tenant-scope, injection, secrets, SSRF, control-weakening detection; exploit-path-gated findings; no diff, no review. |
| `secure-migration-reviewer` | cat 03 #126 | yes | Whole-migration deploy safety: RLS/policy gaps, GRANT widening, unsafe defaults, destructive/irreversible ops, tenant-scoped backfills, lock risk, expand→contract deploy order, rollback; delegates policy text to `rls-policy-auditor`. |
| `static-analysis-reviewer` | cat 03 #121 adjacent + cat 06/08 | yes | Triages SAST/CodeQL/SARIF on first-party code: dedup, confirm-against-code disposition (TP/FP/dup/accepted), five-axis ranking (reachability/exploitability/asset/tenant/business), written suppression policy. |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for the two Phase 4 clusters:
the **threat & hardening** cluster (`threat-modeler`, `appsec-implementer`,
`secrets-identity-hardener`) and the **security-review** cluster
(`supply-chain-security-reviewer`, `security-pr-reviewer`, `secure-migration-reviewer`,
`static-analysis-reviewer`) — the latter with explicit discrimination against the
shipped `code-reviewer` (general review vs security-specialized). The **tenant-security**
cluster (`multi-tenant-security-tester`, `rls-policy-auditor`) additionally discriminates
against the shipped `tenant-isolation-reviewer` (inspection-based review vs executable
tests vs database-policy audit).

### Skills (Phase 5 — QA, E2E, manual QA & evidence pack)

All under `.claude/skills/<name>/`; every one ships `evals/evals.json` **and**
`evals/trigger-evals.json` (all sixteen sit in one of four overlap clusters). Per
master-prompt §7: QA starts from risk; every layer choice picks the cheapest reliable
layer; E2E is reserved for critical journeys; manual cases are executable by another
tester; screenshot evidence carries naming/masking/metadata/storage rules; Playwright
uses resilient locators and web-first assertions with no arbitrary sleeps; Vite skills
prove `VITE_` secret non-exposure at the `dist/` level; Vitest skills choose the
environment intentionally; flake work classifies, reproduces, fixes one cause, and
proves stability. Four skills have side effects and are **manual-only**
(`disable-model-invocation: true`): `playwright-e2e-engineer` (writes specs, drives a
browser), `clickthrough-test-engineer` (drives a live app), `vitest-unit-component-engineer`
(writes test files, runs suites), and `vite-build-qa-engineer` (runs builds/preview).

**Pulled forward from the QA backlog** (in addition to the 13 canonical Phase 5 skills):
`integration-test-designer` (roadmap #184), `api-contract-test-designer` (roadmap #185),
and `accessibility-test-harness` (roadmap #204) — each with mandatory trigger-eval
discrimination against its nearest neighbors. Per reconciliation §3, `acceptance-criteria-tester`,
`e2e-test-architect`, and `qa-closeout-reporter` stay in the expansion backlog
(`qa-closeout-reporter` overlaps the shipped `ai-closeout-reporter` +
`screenshot-evidence-planner`, whose evidence bundle the closeout consumes).

| Skill | Source (category doc) | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `qa-strategy-architect` | cat 06 #181/#182 | yes | Product-level QA strategy: ranked risk inventory → cheapest-reliable-layer decisions, explicit automation/manual split, evidence per change class, CI gates, ownership; delegates security negatives. |
| `test-plan-designer` | cat 06 #181/#192 | yes | Per-change test plan: risk-traced items with layer/data/environment, objective entry/exit criteria, named artifacts + CI placement, engineer-skill handoffs, explicit out-of-scope list. |
| `test-coverage-mapper` | cat 06 #191/#192 | yes | Surface-inventory-first coverage audit; maps by reading assertions (theater ≠ coverage); risk-ranked gap list with cheapest fill layer; honest covered/theater/uncovered/not-inspected statement. |
| `qa-automation-architect` | cat 06 #200/#211/#212 | yes | Automation blueprint: tools per layer with rationale, structure/fixtures/auth-state, parallel-safe isolation, artifacts, CI tiers with bounded logged retries, flake policy, small-step migration. |
| `playwright-e2e-engineer` | cat 06 #187/#189 | **no** (manual-only; writes specs, drives browser) | Critical-journey Playwright specs: role/label locators (testid = flagged semantics gap), web-first assertions, zero sleeps/networkidle, storageState per persona, failure traces, honest run reports incl. pass-on-retry. |
| `clickthrough-test-engineer` | cat 06 #222 | **no** (manual-only; drives a live app) | Pre-planned route-by-route interactive walkthrough (forms w/ invalid input, dialogs, permissions, states, console), severity-rated defects with masked evidence, honest executed/skipped coverage. |
| `manual-test-case-creator` | cat 06 #221 | yes | Stranger-executable manual cases: exact data/roles/environment, one observable expected result per step, screenshot checkpoints, pass/fail/blocked verdict rules, cleanup, requirement traces. |
| `screenshot-evidence-planner` | cat 06 #223 | yes | Evidence policy: risk-justified checkpoints, deterministic naming, mandatory pre-storage block-out masking, metadata (build/env/persona/viewport), storage/retention classes, case/PR/closeout linkage. |
| `vitest-unit-component-engineer` | cat 06 #183 + cat 05 #180 | **no** (manual-only; writes test files, runs suites) | Vitest unit/component tests: intentional node-vs-DOM environment per file, owned-seam mocks only, Testing Library user-facing queries, determinism, real run output, regression spot-check. |
| `vite-build-qa-engineer` | cat 05 #178 + cat 06 #217 | **no** (manual-only; runs builds/preview) | Build-artifact QA: `VITE_` env classification, dist-level secret value+pattern proof, build/preview parity (base, deep links, modes), bundle budgets + sourcemap policy; exposures → `secrets-identity-hardener`. |
| `flaky-test-detective` | cat 06 #209/#210 | yes | Classify → reproduce with counts → fix ONE cause → prove stability with repeated runs; no retries/sleeps/weakened assertions; product races routed as product bugs; quarantine with owner/ticket/expiry. |
| `test-data-architect` | cat 06 #196–#199 | yes | Persona/baseline catalog (read-only), per-layer data sources, determinism, worker-scoped parallel isolation, synthetic-only PII posture, structural cleanup + traceability, schema-coupled seed evolution. |
| `regression-suite-curator` | cat 06 #190/#210 | yes | Evidence-based promote/retain/demote/retire with written rationale (never silent deletion), protected security regressions (human-approval to retire), enforced quarantine registry, tier-budget fit. |
| `integration-test-designer` | cat 06 **#184 (pulled forward)** | yes | The layer BETWEEN unit and E2E: real service/command/DB/auth/permission boundaries, named faked seams with rationale, real-path auth minting, persisted-state assertions, no browser; security matrices deferred to `multi-tenant-security-tester`. |
| `api-contract-test-designer` | cat 06 **#185 (pulled forward)** | yes | Contract VERIFICATION (not design): provider/consumer roles, request/response schema + error-envelope validation, additive-vs-breaking CI gate, version coverage, fake-fidelity re-validation; contract design stays with `api-event-architect`. |
| `accessibility-test-harness` | cat 06 **#204 (pulled forward)** + cat 05 #173 | yes | WCAG-pinned a11y harness: automated scans (component/E2E/CI, baseline+ratchet) AND manual keyboard/focus/contrast/screen-reader checklists; explicit about what automation cannot judge. |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for the four Phase 5 clusters:
**strategy/plan/coverage** (`qa-strategy-architect`, `test-plan-designer`,
`test-coverage-mapper`, `qa-automation-architect`), **test-level**
(`vitest-unit-component-engineer`, `integration-test-designer`, `playwright-e2e-engineer`,
`api-contract-test-designer`), **UI/manual** (`clickthrough-test-engineer`,
`manual-test-case-creator`, `screenshot-evidence-planner`, `accessibility-test-harness`),
and **unit/build/flake/data** (`vite-build-qa-engineer`, `flaky-test-detective`,
`test-data-architect`, `regression-suite-curator`) — with cross-phase discrimination
against the shipped `code-reviewer`, `full-codebase-auditor`, `api-event-architect`,
`multi-tenant-security-tester`, `tdd-engineer`, `systematic-debugger`,
`secrets-identity-hardener`, and `ai-closeout-reporter`.

### Skills (Phase 6 — cloud, DevOps, reliability & release pack)

All under `.claude/skills/<name>/`; every one ships `evals/evals.json` **and**
`evals/trigger-evals.json` (all ten sit in one of three overlap clusters). Per
master-prompt §8: cloud work starts cloud-neutral (requirements, constraints,
compliance, latency, regions, availability, cost, operability, risk BEFORE
service mapping); provider skills stay provider-idiomatic without inventing
product specifics (SKU/quota/price claims become verification items); release
skills demand evidence (CI checks on the release commit, artifacts, rollback
path), not vibes; runbooks meet the stranger-executability bar
(`manual-test-case-creator` discipline); SLOs derive from user journeys with
error budgets, and paging fires on symptoms, not causes. Two skills have side
effects and are **manual-only** (`disable-model-invocation: true`):
`ci-pipeline-architect` (edits pipeline definitions — behavior-steering,
secret-adjacent files that execute on push) and `observability-operator`
(edits live alert/dashboard config, executes operational queries).

Per reconciliation §3, the execution-plan `rollback-strategy-designer` is
**merged into `rollback-runbook-author`** (strategy + runbook are one
artifact); the remaining Phase 6 expansion backlog stays unbuilt (see below).

| Skill | Source (category doc) | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cloud-architecture-decider` | master §8 (cloud) | yes | Cloud-neutral decision: nine-axis requirements record (verified/assumed per entry), provider-neutral logical architecture, isolation/compliance hard filters BEFORE scoring, managed-vs-self-hosted per capability with the operational bill, exit costs + reopen triggers; ADR handoff. |
| `azure-saas-architect` | master §8 (cloud) | yes | Decided-Azure mapping: Entra ID + managed identities + OIDC federation, VNets/Private Link, per-store tenant-isolation mechanism (elastic pools, Cosmos partition keys, Blob prefixes), compute by team maturity, Azure Policy/Defender posture, Bicep/Terraform, tag-keyed cost controls; SKU/limit/price claims → verification items. |
| `aws-saas-architect` | master §8 (cloud) | yes | Decided-AWS mapping: Organizations/OU + SCPs, IAM roles + OIDC federation, VPC/PrivateLink, per-store tenant-isolation mechanism (Aurora silos, DynamoDB leading keys, S3 prefixes), compute by team maturity, Security Hub/GuardDuty posture, Terraform/CDK, activated cost-allocation tags; quota/type/price claims → verification items. |
| `iac-reviewer` | cat 07 #245 (+#257/#258 adjacent) | yes | Review-only IaC audit, blast radius FIRST (replace/delete of stateful resources), public exposure, IAM width deltas, secrets in code AND state, tenant-isolation impact, drift, pinning, cost flags; apply-safety verdict; never applies, never runs plan against live backends. |
| `ci-pipeline-architect` | cat 07 #238 (+#237/#239/#240) | **no** (manual-only; edits pipeline definitions) | Stage graph with blocking semantics + latency budget, CI secret governance (OIDC over stored keys, fork-PR posture, job→secret map), cache/artifact governance with provenance, environment promotion with named-human gates, branch-protection alignment; composes qa-automation-architect tiers, vite-build-qa-engineer, supply-chain pinning rules. |
| `release-readiness-reviewer` | cat 07 #241 (+#242) | yes | Evidence-based ship/no-ship gate: every dimension cites a verifiable artifact or is MISSING (CI on the release SHA, artifact provenance, test-signal fit, migration review, rollback path + rehearsal, flags, docs, observability, approvals); unknown = No-Go with the evidence that flips it; the same-named SUBAGENT composes this skill. |
| `rollback-runbook-author` | cat 07 #243 (+#242; absorbs rollback-strategy-designer) | yes | Rollback strategy + stranger-executable runbook in one artifact: roll-back-vs-fix-forward criteria with time-box, per-layer primitives in stated order, previous-good artifact by id, bad-window data repair, freeze step, rehearsal log + staleness triggers; authors only, never executes. |
| `observability-operator` | cat 07 #246/#247/#248/#252 | **no** (manual-only; edits live alert/dashboard config, runs operational queries) | Hands-on instrumentation (structured, correlated, redacted-at-emission), truthful health checks with timeouts, alerts with severity/owner/runbook-link/justified-threshold, query-verified claims, silences only with owner+expiry; implements slo-reliability-architect's design. |
| `slo-reliability-architect` | cat 07 #251 (+#247 design side) | yes | Journey-derived SLOs: symptom-based SLIs with measurement points + blind spots, targets with error budgets in user units, burn-rate paging with cause-alert demotions, failure-mode analysis, budget policy with consequences + decider, per-tenant/noisy-neighbor views. |
| `incident-response-runbook` | cat 07 #249 (+#250) | yes | One-minute severity ladder (ambiguity classifies up), IC/comms/ops roles with small-org collapse rule, triage to decision points, containment by REFERENCE to the rollback artifact, tenant-aware comms with legal gate on exposure, during-incident evidence capture, blameless postmortem where every finding lands (regression-suite-curator, observability-operator, runbook fix, architecture, or owned accepted risk). |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for the three Phase 6
clusters: **cloud-architecture** (`cloud-architecture-decider`,
`azure-saas-architect`, `aws-saas-architect`, `iac-reviewer`), **delivery**
(`ci-pipeline-architect`, `release-readiness-reviewer`, `rollback-runbook-author`),
and **reliability** (`observability-operator`, `slo-reliability-architect`,
`incident-response-runbook`) — with cross-phase discrimination against the shipped
`architecture-designer`, `saas-platform-architect`, `secure-migration-reviewer`,
`supply-chain-security-reviewer`, `security-pr-reviewer`, `qa-automation-architect`,
`vite-build-qa-engineer`, `code-reviewer`, `audit-log-architect`,
`systematic-debugger`, `regression-suite-curator`, `qa-strategy-architect`,
`saas-cost-architect`, and the `release-readiness-reviewer` **subagent**
(delegated review lens vs this skill's procedure — the `full-codebase-auditor`
namespace pattern).

### Skills (Phase 7 — AI security & LLM systems pack)

All under `.claude/skills/<name>/`; every one ships `evals/evals.json` **and**
`evals/trigger-evals.json` (all fourteen sit in one of four overlap clusters).
Anchored to the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)** per reconciliation
§3 (D6): v4's 10 skills plus 4 gap additions (`sensitive-disclosure-guard`
LLM02, `model-poisoning-reviewer` LLM04, `system-prompt-leakage-reviewer`
LLM07, `ai-misinformation-guard` LLM09). Per master-prompt §9: user input,
retrieved documents, webpages, tickets, emails, logs, tool outputs, and model
outputs are untrusted unless proven otherwise; untrusted content never modifies
system instructions, tool permissions, identity, access policy, or the
execution plan; RAG authz is enforced at retrieval time; tool access is
least-privilege with side effects approval-gated; AI outputs are
schema-validated before use; red-team/eval cases, telemetry/cost controls,
kill switch/fallback, and incident hooks are present where relevant. These skills
**compose** the shipped tenant/security/cost/governance/reliability packs rather
than re-deriving them. Three skills have side effects and are **manual-only**
(`disable-model-invocation: true`): `prompt-injection-defender` (edits
prompts/guardrail code), `ai-evaluation-harness` (runs evals that spend
tokens/money), and `ai-router-architect` (wires live providers/credentials).
The other eleven — including `structured-output-validator`, a design/spec skill
that produces a contract and hands wiring off — stay model-invocable.

Per reconciliation §3, **LLM03 (Supply Chain) is extend-existing**: the shipped
Phase 4 `supply-chain-security-reviewer` was extended (scoped diff) to cover the
AI/ML supply chain — third-party models, datasets, and fine-tuning adapters
(provenance, revision pinning, unsafe pickle/`torch.load` serialization vs
safetensors), with an explicit acquire-vs-ingest boundary handing curated-data
and pipeline integrity to `model-poisoning-reviewer`. **LLM10 (Unbounded
Consumption)** DoS/denial-of-wallet coverage is baked INTO
`ai-cost-guardrail-designer`, not a separate skill. `ai-evaluation-harness`
absorbs the AI security test harness (no separate `ai-security-test-harness`).

| Skill | OWASP LLM Top 10 | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ai-threat-modeler` | cross-cutting | yes | AI-specific threat model: AI assets + trust boundaries (all untrusted content), per-boundary threats anchored to LLM Top 10, abuse cases, exploit-path-gated severity, each mitigation mapped to an owning skill + red-team case; composes threat-modeler for the classic surface. |
| `prompt-injection-defender` | LLM01 | **no** (manual-only; edits prompts/guardrail code) | Layered injection defense: trust zones, the untrusted-content invariant, content/instruction separation, and — the primary layer — deterministic action authorization OUTSIDE the model; direct + indirect payloads; red-team suite with SAFE-outcome assertions. |
| `rag-security-architect` | LLM08 | yes | RAG/vector-store security: authorization AT RETRIEVAL TIME (never post-filter), per-tenant index scoping, document-ACL propagation, embedding risks (inversion/membership/poisoning/stale-permission); composes tenant-isolation-reviewer + multi-tenant-data-architect. |
| `agent-tool-safety-guard` | LLM06 | yes | Least-privilege tool access: per-tool blast-radius matrix, calling-user authority (no service-account confused deputy), argument validation before execution, approval gates on irreversible actions, tool-chain composition abuse; composes human-approval-boundary + agent-authorization-matrix. |
| `llm-output-safety-reviewer` | LLM05 | yes | Output-handling review: model output as untrusted data to render/execute/URL/tool/store sinks (XSS/RCE/SSRF/injection/second-order), context-correct encoding, generated-code sandboxing; exploit-flow-gated findings. |
| `ai-evaluation-harness` | cross-cutting | **no** (manual-only; runs evals that spend tokens/money) | Versioned eval dataset (representative + adversarial/red-team + regression), per-dimension graders + thresholds (quality/schema/safety/grounding/injection/latency/cost), CI regression gate; absorbs the AI security test harness; honest real-run reporting (D3). |
| `ai-cost-guardrail-designer` | LLM10 (DoS/denial-of-wallet) | yes | Consumption guardrails: per-request token caps, tenant-scoped budgets/rate limits, agent loop/recursion bounds, fail-safe degraded mode + kill switch, burn-rate alerts before exhaustion; composes saas-cost-architect + observability-operator. |
| `ai-governance-risk-reviewer` | cross-cutting | yes | AI governance/risk posture: impact-based risk tiering, oversight-to-tier matching, accountable ownership, AI disclosure/consent, model/feature card, obligation→control mapping (EU AI Act tiers, NIST AI RMF) without asserting legal conclusions; composes ai-sdlc-operating-model + agent-governance-audit. |
| `ai-router-architect` | cross-cutting | **no** (manual-only; wires live providers/credentials) | Centralized model-routing layer: one interface, server-side-only credentials, task/cost routing, choke-point cost enforcement, per-call telemetry, resilient fallback + circuit breaker + no-deploy kill switch, idempotent retries; composes secrets-identity-hardener + observability-operator. |
| `structured-output-validator` | LLM05 companion | yes | Output-shape contract: schema (fields/types/enums/ranges), validate-before-use, semantic checks beyond shape (tenant-scoped ids), bounded failure handling; shape-is-not-safety handoffs to llm-output-safety-reviewer + agent-tool-safety-guard. |
| `sensitive-disclosure-guard` | LLM02 *(NEW)* | yes | Disclosure defense: data-minimization + pre-model redaction of secrets/PII/other-tenant data, output-path echo/bleed checks, log redaction at emission, provider retention/training posture; composes tenant-isolation-reviewer + secrets-identity-hardener. |
| `model-poisoning-reviewer` | LLM04 *(NEW)* | yes | Training/feedback/ingestion integrity: contributor-trust assessment, poisoning paths, feedback-loop Sybil defense, ingestion-as-truth integrity, provenance/holdout controls; acquire-vs-ingest boundary with supply-chain-security-reviewer. |
| `system-prompt-leakage-reviewer` | LLM07 *(NEW)* | yes | Two axes: no secrets in the prompt (extract + rotate via secrets-identity-hardener) AND no security dependence on prompt secrecy — **system prompts are NOT security controls**; enforcement is deterministic and lives OUTSIDE the LLM; extraction-is-harmless framing. |
| `ai-misinformation-guard` | LLM09 *(NEW)* | yes | Anti-misinformation: grounding in retrieved sources (not memory), citation-to-claim verification, calibrated uncertainty/refusal, fact validation before action, package/API hallucination (slopsquatting) checks, overreliance-aware UX; composes rag-security-architect + ai-governance-risk-reviewer. |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for the four Phase 7
clusters: **threat & injection** (`ai-threat-modeler`, `prompt-injection-defender`,
`system-prompt-leakage-reviewer`, `sensitive-disclosure-guard`), **data &
retrieval** (`rag-security-architect`, `model-poisoning-reviewer`), **output &
agency** (`agent-tool-safety-guard`, `llm-output-safety-reviewer`,
`structured-output-validator`, `ai-misinformation-guard`), and **AI platform
ops** (`ai-evaluation-harness`, `ai-cost-guardrail-designer`,
`ai-governance-risk-reviewer`, `ai-router-architect`) — with cross-phase
discrimination against the shipped `threat-modeler`, `security-pr-reviewer`,
`supply-chain-security-reviewer`, `multi-tenant-security-tester`,
`multi-tenant-data-architect`, `tenant-isolation-reviewer`, `secrets-identity-hardener`,
`saas-cost-architect`, `plan-entitlement-architect`, `observability-operator`,
`agent-authorization-matrix`, `human-approval-boundary`, `agent-governance-audit`,
`ai-sdlc-operating-model`, `regression-suite-curator`, `qa-automation-architect`,
`api-contract-test-designer`, and the `ai-security-red-team-reviewer` **subagent**
(which composes these skills — design/predict here vs hands-on adversarial probing there).

### Skills (Phase 7.5 — agentic AI security pack)

All under `.claude/skills/<name>/`; every one ships `evals/evals.json` **and**
`evals/trigger-evals.json` (the agentic cluster overlaps internally and with
Phase 7). Anchored to the **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026)**,
ASI01–ASI10, per reconciliation §3 (D7): **6 new skills + 3 extensions of
existing skills**. The Agentic Top 10 **extends, not replaces, the LLM Top 10
(D6)** — agent systems inherit every Phase 7 LLM-side risk; this pack adds
the autonomy, tool, identity, memory, and multi-agent risks on top. Per D7,
**ASI08 and ASI10 merge into ONE `agent-containment-reviewer`** (fault
propagation and the containment-gap-once-drift-begins are two halves of the
same review — same inputs: agent topology, autonomy boundaries, kill/rollback
paths; it also covers the agentic slice of the backlog candidate
`ai-feature-kill-switch-designer`). Nothing else collapses: ASI01 vs ASI06 vs
ASI10 stay distinct (direct goal alteration vs stored-memory corruption vs
autonomous drift). One skill has side effects and is **manual-only**
(`disable-model-invocation: true`): `agent-goal-hijack-defender` (edits agent
loop/planner code and prompts). The other five are pure review/design skills
and stay model-invocable.

**Extensions (scoped additive diffs, not new skills):** ASI02 + the tool-side
slice of ASI05 extend Phase 7 `agent-tool-safety-guard` (tool misuse through
legitimate grants, side-effect limits, NL-driven execution paths,
code-execution tools as a maximal-blast-radius class); ASI05 extends Phase 7
`llm-output-safety-reviewer` (autonomous generate-and-run loops, per-run
ephemeral sandboxes, sandbox escape/persistence, NL-to-execution path maps);
ASI04 extends Phase 4 `supply-chain-security-reviewer` AGAIN (after D6/LLM03)
to the agentic supply chain (MCP servers and manifests, tool/skill
registries, plugin packages, A2A dependencies — install-vs-runtime seam with
`inter-agent-comms-reviewer`).

| Skill | OWASP Agentic Top 10 | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent-goal-hijack-defender` | ASI01 | **no** (manual-only; edits agent loop/planner code + prompts) | Goal/plan integrity across multi-step runs: pinned goal record outside the model context, principal-only mutation channel, per-step tracing with deviation signals, drift response, per-channel hijack red-team suite; builds on `prompt-injection-defender` (LLM01 owns the vector). |
| `agent-identity-privilege-reviewer` | ASI03 | yes | Agent identity architecture: distinct least-privilege identity per agent, task/time-scoped credentials, delegation chains that attenuate (never amplify), confused-deputy closure, dual attribution (principal + agent); complements `secrets-identity-hardener` (custody fixer). |
| `memory-context-poisoning-reviewer` | ASI06 | yes | Persistent memory/stored-context poisoning: write-path trust classes, validation-before-write, per-entry provenance, tenant/user/session scoping at write AND recall, TTL + purge with derived-state rollback, recalled memory as data never instructions; distinct from `model-poisoning-reviewer` (LLM04) and `rag-security-architect` (LLM08). |
| `inter-agent-comms-reviewer` | ASI07 | yes | A2A/MCP message security: per-edge mutual authn, end-to-end integrity, replay bounds, confidentiality, topology allowlists, spoofed-result handling; enforces authenticated ≠ trusted — peer messages never re-task, change permissions, or assert approvals. |
| `agent-containment-reviewer` | ASI08 + ASI10 (merged) | yes | One containment review: cascade half (blast-radius isolation, bounded upstream trust, circuit breakers, checkpoints/rollback, retry-storm/fan-out limits) + rogue half (drift baselines, agent inventory/lifecycle, kill switches that SEVER AUTHORITY — credentials revoked, not processes killed); composes `ai-cost-guardrail-designer` + `incident-response-runbook`. |
| `human-agent-trust-reviewer` | ASI09 | yes | Adversarial review of the approval layer: consent fatigue (rate/latency signals), self-reported summaries vs system-verified facts, bundling/salami-slicing, urgency manipulation, automation-bias controls; counterpart to `human-approval-boundary` (that skill places the gates; this attacks their resilience). |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for all six as one
**agentic cluster**: internal discrimination (goal hijack vs memory poisoning
vs drift/containment vs identity vs comms vs approval-trust) plus cross-phase
discrimination against the shipped `prompt-injection-defender` (LLM01 vs
ASI01), `model-poisoning-reviewer` (LLM04 vs ASI06), `rag-security-architect`
(LLM08 vs ASI06), `agent-tool-safety-guard`, `llm-output-safety-reviewer`,
`agent-authorization-matrix`, `human-approval-boundary`,
`secrets-identity-hardener`, `agent-memory-governance`,
`authorization-matrix-designer`, `api-event-architect`,
`ai-cost-guardrail-designer`, `incident-response-runbook`,
`observability-operator`, `agent-governance-audit`, `ai-misinformation-guard`,
`ai-governance-risk-reviewer`, and the `ai-security-red-team-reviewer`
**subagent**.

### Skills (Compliance & Governance batch — D9)

All under `.claude/skills/<name>/`; every one ships `evals/evals.json`
**and** `evals/trigger-evals.json` (all nine form one compliance cluster).
Anchored to reconciliation §3's "Compliance & Governance batch" subsection
and D9, **including every per-source verification flag**: SOC 2 is an AICPA
**attestation** (a CPA's examination), never a certification — 27001/42001
are the certifiable management-system standards; 27001 Annex A counts
(93 = 37/8/14/34) are secondary-sourced and 42001 Annex A counts conflict
across sources (deliberately unstated); the SOC 2 Type 1/Type 2 definitions
and Security-as-required-baseline are CPA-firm-sourced; the ~60–80%
cross-framework overlap is an industry estimate; the vendor-market
rationale is positioning, not a standards claim — every skill carries these
in a **Compliance Precision Rules** section as
verify-against-the-standard-before-citing items. Architecture per D9:
**ONE shared control foundation + framework projections + a crosswalk**,
NOT three parallel skill sets. The batch **MAPS controls that largely
already exist** (Phase 3/4 technical controls, the Phase 5 evidence pack,
Phase 1.5 + Phase 7 AI governance) and produces auditor-grade evidence on
top — net-new is mostly ISO management-system artifacts (SoA, internal
audit, management review) and evidence plumbing. Invocability was evaluated
explicitly: all nine are mapping/documentation/design skills producing
proposal artifacts — none edits live governance artifacts or evidence
stores (store mutation and controlled-document rewrites are excluded via
Stop Conditions), so **all nine are model-invocable**.

| Skill | Layer (D9) | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `compliance-control-foundation` | Shared foundation | yes | One framework-agnostic catalog (7 domains + AI governance): each control ONCE with objective/owner/mechanism/evidence hook, mapped by name to shipped Phase 3/4 artifacts; framework-neutral text; honest implemented/partial/missing status incl. the D8 residues. |
| `compliance-evidence-collector` | Shared foundation | yes | Evidence OVER TIME (SOC 2 Type 2's core demand, reused for ISO surveillance): per-control type, cadence matched to operating frequency, population for sampling, collector, retention, integrity; window-coverage matrix with recover-or-except holes; reuses the Phase 5 evidence pack; never mutates a live evidence store. |
| `statement-of-applicability-author` | Shared foundation | yes | The ISO-mandatory SoA serving BOTH 27001 and 42001: per-control include/exclude with 6.1.3 risk-treatment traces, verifiable exclusions, status mapped to foundation mechanisms, controlled-document diffs; requires the licensed Annex A table — never reconstructs entries or counts from memory. |
| `iso-27001-isms-architect` | Framework projection | yes | ISMS clauses 4–10 (incl. the Amd 1:2024 climate-relevance check), four-theme Annex A selection via the foundation; headline net-new = risk register, internal audit program, management review; theme counts flagged secondary-verify-before-citing; readiness plan, never a certification claim. |
| `iso-42001-aims-architect` | Framework projection | yes | AIMS clauses 4–10 + the three assessments (AI risk 6.1.2/8.2, AI risk treatment 6.1.3/8.3, AI system impact 6.1.4/8.4 on individuals/societies); maps the Phase 1.5 pack + `ai-governance-risk-reviewer` as operational mechanisms; Annex A counts never stated (sources conflict); ISMS-delta design when 27001 exists. |
| `soc2-trust-criteria-mapper` | Framework projection | yes | ATTESTATION-not-certification scoping: system boundary, commitment-driven category selection (Security baseline + optional four), Type 1 vs Type 2 with window feasibility, subservice-organization carve-outs; Type definitions flagged CPA-firm-sourced — verify against the AICPA guide. |
| `multi-framework-crosswalk` | Cross-cutting | yes | One row per control → 27001 Annex A + SOC 2 TSC + 42001 Annex A (+ AI RMF function); edition-pinned, text-in-hand cells only, FULL/PARTIAL(residue) honesty, explicit joint sets; the 60–80% overlap cited only as flagged industry estimate. |
| `compliance-gap-auditor` | Cross-cutting | yes | ONE parameterized audit vs chosen framework(s): MET/PARTIAL/GAP/UNVERIFIABLE per requirement from cited evidence (missing evidence is never MET), blockers-first remediation order, shared-gap dividend; readiness assessment, never an audit opinion. |
| `ai-lifecycle-risk-manager` | Cross-cutting | yes | NIST AI RMF GOVERN/MAP/MEASURE/MANAGE operationalized per lifecycle stage with owners, triggers, and a register; voluntary + under-revision flags encoded; composes feature reviews, threat models, evals, incident machinery; companion to the AIMS — never presented as certifiable. |

Trigger-overlap coverage (`evals/trigger-evals.json`) ships for all nine as
one **compliance cluster**: internal discrimination (foundation vs evidence
program vs SoA vs the three projections vs crosswalk vs gap audit vs
lifecycle program) plus cross-phase discrimination against the shipped
`agent-governance-audit` (process compliance of ONE agent change vs
framework compliance of the org), `ai-governance-risk-reviewer` (one AI
feature's governance posture vs org-level certification readiness),
`ai-sdlc-operating-model`, `audit-log-architect`,
`screenshot-evidence-planner`, `manual-test-case-creator`,
`authorization-matrix-designer`, `threat-modeler`, `ai-threat-modeler`,
`ai-evaluation-harness`, `slo-reliability-architect`,
`incident-response-runbook`, and `full-codebase-auditor`.

### Skills (D13 pull 1 — library meta / self-application)

First pull from the banked D13 scope (reconciliation §3 D13 subsection;
decision D18): the library starts applying its own discipline to itself.
Ships `evals/evals.json` **and** `evals/trigger-evals.json`. Pure review
skill — produces a verdict report, edits nothing — so it is
**model-invocable**. It COMPOSES `scripts/validate-skills.py` (runs it
first as the entry gate; never re-implements or re-scores its mechanical
checks) and is discriminated from `agent-governance-audit` (a change's
process trail vs a skill definition's quality). The other four D13
candidates (`eval-runner-designer`, `skill-usage-instrumenter`,
`skill-deprecation-planner`, `library-diff-reviewer`) remain banked —
candidate, not built; the trigger-evals pin the `library-diff-reviewer`
seam now (whole skill-adding PR vs ONE skill's quality) so neither skill
absorbs the other's scope when both exist.

| Skill | Source (D13) | Model-invocable? | Trigger summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `skill-quality-reviewer` | reconciliation §3 D13 — highest-leverage candidate, pulled first per the D13 standing rule | yes | The judgment layer above the mechanical validator: validator-first gate, then the seven checks it cannot script — trigger quality (trigger-oriented vs merely descriptive), trigger collision against the FULL shipped corpus (colliders NAMED), duplication/extension (LLM03/ASI04 precedent), eval integrity (boundary cases vs hollow filler), section substance (Stop Conditions that actually refuse), scope discipline, invocation posture. Per-check PASS/CONCERN/FAIL with quoted evidence → ship / revise / reject / make-it-an-extension. |

`rollback-runbook-author` (no separate skill). The Phase 6 **expansion backlog**
(`cloud-security-baseline-reviewer`, `resilience-architecture-reviewer`,
`migration-deployment-runbook`, `environment-parity-reviewer`,
`database-backup-verifier`) remains backlog, built in Phase 8 batches.

> Note: `release-readiness-reviewer` and `full-codebase-auditor` exist as **subagents**
> (review lens) and also as **skills** (procedure) — `full-codebase-auditor` skill shipped
> in Phase 2; `release-readiness-reviewer` skill shipped here in Phase 6. Different
> namespaces (`.claude/agents/` vs `.claude/skills/`); the agent composes the skill.

### Phase 7 — AI security & LLM systems (P1)
✅ **Implemented** — all 14 skills (v4's 10 + 4 OWASP LLM Top 10 gap additions,
D6) moved to
[Implemented → Skills (Phase 7)](#skills-phase-7--ai-security--llm-systems-pack)
above. Source: [`docs/skills/09-ai-software-engineering.md`](skills/09-ai-software-engineering.md)
and the reconciliation doc §3 Phase 7 coverage map (D6).
Per D6: **LLM03** is extend-existing — the shipped Phase 4
`supply-chain-security-reviewer` was extended (scoped diff) to the AI/ML supply
chain (models, datasets, fine-tuning adapters); **LLM10** DoS/denial-of-wallet
is baked into `ai-cost-guardrail-designer`; and `ai-evaluation-harness` absorbs
the AI security test harness (no separate `ai-security-test-harness`). The
Phase 7 **expansion backlog** (`ai-provider-adapter-designer`,
`prompt-contract-designer`, `ai-human-in-the-loop-designer`,
`ai-autonomy-boundary-designer`, `ai-feature-kill-switch-designer` — whose
agentic slice is now covered by `agent-containment-reviewer`) remains
backlog, built in Phase 8 batches. Phase 7.5 (agentic AI security, D7) is
implemented below; the Compliance & Governance batch (D9) follows it.

### Phase 7.5 — Agentic AI security (P1)
✅ **Implemented** — all 6 new skills + 3 extensions (OWASP Agentic Top 10,
D7) moved to
[Implemented → Skills (Phase 7.5)](#skills-phase-75--agentic-ai-security-pack)
above. Source: the reconciliation doc §3 Phase 7.5 coverage map (D7),
anchored to the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026), ASI01–ASI10.
Per D7: **ASI08 + ASI10 merged** into `agent-containment-reviewer`;
**ASI02/ASI05** extend Phase 7 `agent-tool-safety-guard` and
`llm-output-safety-reviewer` (scoped diffs); **ASI04** extends Phase 4
`supply-chain-security-reviewer` again after the D6/LLM03 extension. The
Compliance & Governance batch (D9) is implemented below.

### Compliance & Governance batch (D9)
✅ **Implemented** — all 9 skills moved to
[Implemented → Skills (Compliance & Governance batch)](#skills-compliance--governance-batch--d9)
above. Source: the reconciliation doc §3 "Compliance & Governance batch"
subsection + D9 in §5, including every per-source verification flag.
Architecture per D9: one shared control foundation
(`compliance-control-foundation`, `compliance-evidence-collector`,
`statement-of-applicability-author`) + framework projections
(`iso-27001-isms-architect`, `iso-42001-aims-architect`,
`soc2-trust-criteria-mapper`) + cross-cutting (`multi-framework-crosswalk`,
`compliance-gap-auditor`, `ai-lifecycle-risk-manager`) — the 9 reconciled
candidates, already merged, NOT split into per-framework variants. The
batch maps controls that largely already exist (Phases 3/4, the Phase 5
evidence pack, Phase 1.5 + Phase 7 AI governance) and produces
auditor-grade evidence on top.

### D13 — Library meta / self-application (banked; first pull implemented)
`skill-quality-reviewer` ✅ **implemented** (D18) — moved to
[Implemented → Skills (D13 pull 1)](#skills-d13-pull-1--library-meta--self-application)
above. The remaining four D13 candidates (`eval-runner-designer`,
`skill-usage-instrumenter`, `skill-deprecation-planner`,
`library-diff-reviewer`) stay banked — candidate, not built. Source: the
reconciliation doc §3 D13 subsection + D13/D18 in §5.

### Phase 8 — Backlog expansion (P2)
Remaining roadmap skills, generated in validated batches of ≤20 (see reconciliation §4.1).

## Capability map (300+ target backlog)

The strategic backlog the library was audited against lives in
[`docs/300-repeatable-software-saas-skills-roadmap.md`](300-repeatable-software-saas-skills-roadmap.md)
— the original 300. Per the D12 standing rule the library is NOT capped at 300 skills: this
is a 300+ target backlog, and skills ship on demand and framework coverage, not count:

| Category | Count | Document |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Software Architecture & Engineering | 55 | [`01`](skills/01-software-architecture-engineering.md) |
| SaaS Platform Architecture | 35 | [`02`](skills/02-saas-platform-architecture.md) |
| SaaS Security, Multi-Tenancy & RLS | 40 | [`03`](skills/03-saas-security-rls.md) |
| Backend, API & Data Engineering | 30 | [`04`](skills/04-backend-api-data-engineering.md) |
| Frontend & UX Engineering | 20 | [`05`](skills/05-frontend-ux-engineering.md) |
| QA, Test Architecture & Validation | 55 | [`06`](skills/06-qa-test-engineering.md) |
| DevOps, Release & Reliability | 25 | [`07`](skills/07-devops-release-reliability.md) |
| AI-Era SDLC & Agent Operating Discipline | 20 | [`08`](skills/08-ai-era-sdlc-agent-ops.md) |
| AI Software Engineering & LLM Systems | 20 | [`09`](skills/09-ai-software-engineering.md) |
| **Total** | **300** | |

## Evals & validation note

Every implemented skill must ship `evals/evals.json` (and `evals/trigger-evals.json` when its
trigger overlaps another skill). **Evals are structurally validated only — there is no runner
yet (decision D3).** Run `python scripts/validate-skills.py` before every commit that touches
`.claude/skills/`.
