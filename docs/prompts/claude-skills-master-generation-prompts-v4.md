# Claude Skills Master Generation Prompts v4

**Prepared for:** `nguyenpv1980-wq/Claude-Skills`  
**Prepared on:** 2026-07-06  
**Use from:** Claude Code at the root of the `Claude-Skills` repository.  
**Intent:** Generate reusable Claude Code Skills and agent/orchestrator prompts in controlled phases.

---

## 0. How to Use This File

Use this after the repo contains or can access:

```text
docs/300-repeatable-software-saas-skills-roadmap.md
docs/skills/
docs/research/claude-skills-architecture-audit-findings-v4.md
docs/prompts/claude-skills-master-generation-prompts-v4.md
```

If the older v3 support files exist, also read them:

```text
docs/research/claude-skills-saas-cloud-security-knowledge-base.md
docs/prompts/prompt-for-claude-to-generate-skills.md
```

If the v3 files are missing, continue from the v4 audit findings and v4 prompts. Do not stop just because the v3 files are absent.

Do **not** generate the backlog in one pass — the original 300-skill roadmap is a 300+ target backlog (D12 standing rule: ship on demand and framework coverage, not count). Build the foundation, validate it, then continue.

## 1. Master Role Prompt

Paste this first into Claude Code:

```markdown
You are Claude Code acting as a Senior Principal Claude / AI Architect, principal software architect, secure SDLC lead, SaaS platform architect, QA automation architect, cloud reliability architect, and AI security architect.

Your job is to build a reusable Claude Skills library for future engineering work.

This repo is not a product implementation repo. It is a reusable skills and agent-operating-pattern repo.

Read these first:

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/300-repeatable-software-saas-skills-roadmap.md`
3. Every file under `docs/skills/`
4. `docs/research/claude-skills-architecture-audit-findings-v4.md`
5. `docs/prompts/claude-skills-master-generation-prompts-v4.md`
6. `docs/research/claude-skills-saas-cloud-security-knowledge-base.md`, if present
7. `docs/prompts/prompt-for-claude-to-generate-skills.md`, if present

Then inspect the repo tree.

If the roadmap, skills category docs, v4 audit findings, or this v4 prompt are missing, report the missing files and stop before generating skills. If only the older v3 support files are missing, report that and continue from the v4 files.

Operating rules:

- Create actual skills only under `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`.
- Every skill must have `SKILL.md`.
- Every skill must have `evals/evals.json`.
- Use Agent Skills frontmatter.
- The `name` field must match the directory name.
- Keep every `SKILL.md` under 500 lines.
- Keep the main body procedural and concise.
- Use progressive disclosure: references, assets, examples, and scripts only when they reduce errors.
- Do not create one giant skill.
- Do not duplicate large instruction blocks across skills.
- Do not grant broad `allowed-tools`.
- Do not add `allowed-tools` unless narrowly justified.
- Use `disable-model-invocation: true` for side-effect or manual-only skills.
- Do not create product-specific skills.
- Do not include secrets, tokens, URLs with credentials, customer data, or personal data.
- Do not create skills that dynamically modify other skills.
- Do not implement cloud/schema/security/product changes. This repo is for reusable skills only.
- Convert vague best practices into concrete workflow steps, checklists, outputs, and stop conditions.
- Prefer quality over quantity.

Before writing files, produce a skill plan table:

| Skill name | Category | Purpose | Trigger description | User-invocable? | Auto-invocable? | Supporting files | Eval cases |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

After creating or editing files, run or produce a validation report that checks:

- every skill directory has `SKILL.md`;
- frontmatter parses;
- `name` matches directory;
- descriptions are specific and under 1024 characters;
- no `SKILL.md` exceeds 500 lines;
- every skill has `evals/evals.json` (structural existence + JSON parse; no runner yet);
- `evals/trigger-evals.json` parses when present (required for overlapping skills in Phase 8);
- no broad `allowed-tools`;
- side-effect skills are manual-only;
- catalog integrity: `README.md` and `docs/skills-catalog.md` list every real skill and claim none that do not exist;
- product-specific leakage is absent.
```

---

## 2. Phase 0 Prompt — Repo Foundation and Validation

```markdown
Implement Phase 0 only.

Goal: prepare the `Claude-Skills` repo so future skill generation is controlled, auditable, and safe.

Read:

- `README.md`
- `docs/300-repeatable-software-saas-skills-roadmap.md`
- every file under `docs/skills/`
- `docs/research/claude-skills-architecture-audit-findings-v4.md`
- `docs/prompts/claude-skills-master-generation-prompts-v4.md`

Create or update:

1. `docs/skills-catalog.md`
   - Explain the skill packs.
   - List implemented skills separately from backlog skills.
   - Define P0/P1/P2 priority meaning.
   - Explain the difference between skills and agents.

2. `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md` (reconciled decision D2 — real read-only subagents,
   not a `docs/agents/` prompt file)
   - Create the seven read-only reviewer subagents:
     - `principal-architecture-reviewer` (Principal Claude Architect role)
     - `secure-saas-reviewer` (SaaS Security and Tenant Isolation role)
     - `qa-automation-lead` (QA Automation and Release Evidence role)
     - `full-codebase-auditor` (Full Codebase Audit role)
     - `senior-troubleshooting-lead` (Senior Troubleshooting role)
     - `ai-security-red-team-reviewer` (AI Security and LLM Systems role)
     - `release-readiness-reviewer` (Release Captain role)
   - Read-only tools by default. Narrow descriptions.
   - Agents must compose skills and produce evidence.
   - Agents must not duplicate full skill bodies.

3. `scripts/validate-skills.py`
   - Validate `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md` (ignore `_template`).
   - Check required frontmatter.
   - Check `name` matches directory.
   - Check line count under 500.
   - Check description exists and is under 1024 characters.
   - Check `evals/evals.json` exists and parses (structural only — no runner yet, per D3).
   - Validate `evals/trigger-evals.json` as JSON when present.
   - Flag broad `allowed-tools` such as unrestricted Bash.
   - Catalog integrity: every real skill is listed in `docs/skills-catalog.md` and `README.md`;
     the catalog/README must not claim skills that do not exist.
   - Bundled-name collision: no skill name shadows a reserved bundled skill name; no duplicates.
   - Exit cleanly with a "no skills found" status when only `_template` exists.

4. Update `README.md`
   - Add usage guidance.
   - Add how to run validation.
   - Add links to audit findings, prompts, roadmap, and skills catalog.

Do not create actual skills in Phase 0 unless needed for a validator example.

After changes, run the validator if possible. If not possible, explain why and manually inspect the files you created.
```

## 3. Phase 1 Prompt — AI Engineering Operating Discipline Pack

```markdown
Implement Phase 1 only: AI engineering operating discipline.

Create these skills under `.claude/skills/`:

1. `agent-startup-context-gate`
2. `source-of-truth-reconciler`
3. `change-classification-gate`
4. `human-approval-boundary`
5. `reviewable-diff-discipline`
6. `ai-closeout-reporter`
7. `agent-failure-recovery`
8. `agent-instruction-consolidator`

For each skill:

- Create `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Create `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/evals/evals.json`.
- Add references or assets only if useful.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines.
- Make descriptions trigger-oriented.
- Include stop conditions.
- Include validation checklist.
- Include output format.
- Avoid broad `allowed-tools`.

Skill-specific requirements:

`agent-startup-context-gate`
- Forces Claude to inspect repo instructions, README, roadmap, status docs, architecture docs, tests, and relevant files before work.
- Separates facts, assumptions, and missing info.
- Prevents coding before context is established.

`source-of-truth-reconciler`
- Resolves conflicts between user instructions, repo docs, PRs, code, tests, and older memories.
- Prefers current explicit user instruction over older docs.
- Preserves evidence and cites files/lines when possible.

`change-classification-gate`
- Classifies change type: docs, UI, frontend logic, backend, schema, RLS/security, cloud/IaC, AI/agentic, QA, refactor, bug fix, release.
- Maps classification to required validation level.

`human-approval-boundary`
- Stops for explicit approval when work touches schema, RLS, production data, secrets, deployments, billing, destructive migration, broad refactor, or unclear security behavior.
- Does not require approval for low-risk docs-only work unless policy requires it.

`reviewable-diff-discipline`
- Keeps changes small, scoped, intentional, and easy to review.
- Prevents unrelated drive-by edits.

`ai-closeout-reporter`
- Produces final closeout: changed, not changed, files touched, tests run, evidence, risks, skipped validation, next action.

`agent-failure-recovery`
- Handles failed tests, dirty tree, interrupted runs, partial commits, broken branch, or blocked permission.
- Preserves work and avoids destructive cleanup.

`agent-instruction-consolidator`
- Aligns Claude, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, and repo AI instructions.
- Detects conflicts and proposes a single source of truth.

After creating the skills:

- Run `python scripts/validate-skills.py` if it exists.
- Update `docs/skills-catalog.md`.
- Update `README.md` if needed.
- Produce a validation report.
```

## 9.1 Phase 8 Prompt — Backlog Expansion (ported from the execution plan)

```markdown
Implement Phase 8 only, and only after Phases 0–7 validate cleanly.

Goal: convert the remaining backlog (`docs/300-repeatable-software-saas-skills-roadmap.md`
and `docs/skills/` — the original 300, per the D12 standing rule a 300+ target backlog:
ship on demand and framework coverage, not count) into executable skills without lowering
quality.

Read:
- every file under `docs/skills/`
- `docs/skills-catalog.md`
- `docs/reconciliation/step-0-reconciliation-v4.md`
- validation results and any real-use notes from prior phases

Batch rules (non-negotiable):
1. Do not create more than 20 skills per pass.
2. Merge duplicate or overlapping skills instead of creating noisy variants.
3. Prefer one strong skill over five weak ones.
4. Add `evals/trigger-evals.json` for any skill whose description overlaps an existing skill.
5. Update `README.md` and `docs/skills-catalog.md` after each batch.
6. Run `python scripts/validate-skills.py` after each batch.
7. Create a changelog entry explaining the batch.
8. Stop if generated skills become repetitive, too long, or weakly differentiated.

Close each batch with: batch summary, validation result, overlap risks, recommended next batch.
```

## 10. Agent Prompt Pack

**Reconciled (D2):** the real subagents live at `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md` (read-only
default) and are created in Phase 0. The role prompts below are the *design intent* behind
those subagents — use them as reference when refining each `.claude/agents/*.md` file. Do not
also create a separate `docs/agents/agent-orchestrator-prompts.md` (it would duplicate the
subagent bodies). Role → subagent mapping is in
[`docs/reconciliation/step-0-reconciliation-v4.md`](../reconciliation/step-0-reconciliation-v4.md) §5.

## 11. Final Audit Prompt for Claude Code

Use this after any phase.

```markdown
Audit the `Claude-Skills` repo after the latest phase.

Inspect:

- `README.md`
- `docs/skills-catalog.md`
- `docs/agents/`
- `.claude/skills/`
- every `SKILL.md`
- every `evals/evals.json`
- `scripts/validate-skills.py`

Check:

1. Are all skills product-agnostic?
2. Does every skill have clear trigger-oriented frontmatter?
3. Does every `name` match the directory?
4. Is every `SKILL.md` under 500 lines?
5. Does every skill include purpose, use when, inputs, workflow, output format, validation checklist, gotchas, stop conditions, and supporting files?
6. Does every skill have evals?
7. Are eval assertions objective?
8. Are any `allowed-tools` broad or unjustified?
9. Are side-effect skills manual-only?
10. Are references used through progressive disclosure?
11. Is there duplicated boilerplate that should be consolidated?
12. Are security, tenant isolation, QA, and AI safety gates concrete?
13. Does README/catalog match implemented skills?
14. What should be fixed before the next phase?

Produce:

- Executive summary.
- Pass/fail table.
- Findings by severity.
- Exact files/paths.
- Recommended fixes.
- Whether to proceed to next phase.
```

---

## 12. Recommended Execution Order

1. Run the **Master Role Prompt**.
2. Run **Phase 0**.
3. Run the **Final Audit Prompt**.
4. Run **Phase 1** (the operating-discipline pack — reconciled decision D4).
5. Run the **Final Audit Prompt**.
6. Run **Phase 2**.
7. Continue one phase at a time (through **Phase 7**) only after the previous phase passes validation.
8. Run **Phase 8** (backlog expansion, §9.1) last, in validated batches of ≤20 skills.

Do not reward speed over quality. This repo is meant to improve future Claude behavior, so weak skills are worse than no skills.
