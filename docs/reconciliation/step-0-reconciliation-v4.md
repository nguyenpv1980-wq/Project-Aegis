# Step 0 Reconciliation (v4 canonical)

**Prepared:** 2026-07-06
**Repo:** `nguyenpv1980-wq/Claude-Skills`
**Verified HEAD at reconciliation time:** `5f6f404a8e261c89b8264c3282acd32075f54411` — *"Merge PR #1: 300 repeatable Claude skills roadmap"* on `main`.

This document is the single source of truth for how the two overlapping planning tracks
were reconciled before any skills are generated. It is docs-only. It does not create skills.

---

## 1. Canonicalization

Two planning tracks existed in the repo:

- **v4 track** — [`docs/research/claude-skills-architecture-audit-findings-v4.md`](../research/claude-skills-architecture-audit-findings-v4.md)
  and [`docs/prompts/claude-skills-master-generation-prompts-v4.md`](../prompts/claude-skills-master-generation-prompts-v4.md).
- **Execution-plan track** — [`docs/prompts/senior-principal-claude-skills-execution-plan.md`](../prompts/senior-principal-claude-skills-execution-plan.md).

**Decision D1 — the v4 pair is canonical.** The senior-principal execution plan is
reclassified as **historical/reference input**. Everything unique and still valuable in
it (Phase 8 batch rules, the pre-generation plan table, extra validator checks, several
skill names) is **ported into the v4 pair** so nothing is lost. After this reconciliation,
generation follows the v4 prompts only.

Also historical (unchanged, kept as source inputs):
`docs/research/claude-skills-principal-architecture-findings.md`,
`docs/prompts/master-claude-skills-and-agents-development-prompt.md`,
`docs/prompts/phased-claude-skills-prompts.md`,
`docs/roadmaps/product-agnostic-skill-and-agent-roadmap.md`,
`docs/150-claude-skills-roadmap.md`.

## 2. Stale claims removed / corrected

| Stale claim (where) | Reality (2026-07-06) | Action |
|---|---|---|
| "open PR #1", "Continue from or merge PR #1" (v4 audit §2.3, §3 F1, §9) | PR #1 is **merged** into `main` at `5f6f404`. | v4 audit updated to state PR #1 is merged and `main` is the product-agnostic baseline. |
| "`main` is still effectively empty" (execution plan §2.3) | `main` contains the full roadmap, category docs, research, and prompts. | Corrected here; execution plan is now historical so its body is left intact but superseded by this note. |
| Existing work lives on PR branch `docs/300-repeatable-software-saas-skills` (execution plan §2.3) | That branch was fully merged and has been **deleted**. Branch `x` (an older, superseded state) was also fully merged and **deleted**. | Both stale remote branches removed after confirming `git merge-base --is-ancestor` = merged and zero unmerged commits. `main` is the only remaining branch. |

---

## 3. Reconciled phase → executable-skill list (ONE list per phase)

The **v4 phase structure is canonical**. Each row shows the reconciled skill and how the
execution-plan track's names map onto it (merge / move / same). Every skill traces to a
`docs/skills/` category entry where applicable.

### Phase 0 — Foundation (P0) — *this phase*
Standard, templates, eval schema, catalog, validator, README, real subagents, `_template`.
No skills generated. (Both tracks agree.)

### Phase 1 — AI engineering operating-discipline pack (P0)
**Canonical = v4's 8.** The execution plan's Phase 1 mixed operating-discipline with
architecture; the architecture skills are **moved to Phase 2**.

| # | Reconciled skill | Roadmap ref (cat 08) | Merge / move note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `agent-startup-context-gate` | #262 | same in both tracks |
| 2 | `source-of-truth-reconciler` | #269 | absorbs execution-plan `no-silent-assumptions-protocol` (#270) assumption-surfacing behavior |
| 3 | `change-classification-gate` | #264 | absorbs execution-plan `phase-locked-execution` (#263) scope-lock behavior |
| 4 | `human-approval-boundary` | #265 | new canonical name (v4); also carries the "stop when unclear" half of #270 |
| 5 | `reviewable-diff-discipline` | #271 | absorbs execution-plan `exact-file-staging` intent (#272) |
| 6 | `ai-closeout-reporter` | #274 | same intent both tracks |
| 7 | `agent-failure-recovery` | #275 | v4 addition |
| 8 | `agent-instruction-consolidator` | #276 | #276 Agent Instruction Consolidation |

**Moved out of Phase 1 → Phase 2:** `adr-writer`, `system-context-mapper`, `domain-modeler`,
`bounded-context-identifier`, `architecture-designer`, `dependency-direction-guard`,
`refactor-safety-planner`.

### Phase 2 — Core architecture & engineering (P0)
**Canonical = v4's 10:** `domain-modeler`, `architecture-designer`, `adr-writer`,
`docs-first-implementer`, `tdd-engineer`, `systematic-debugger`, `code-reviewer`,
`code-simplifier`, `principal-code-analyst`, `full-codebase-auditor`.

Merges/moves from the execution plan: `grill-with-docs` **→ merged into** `docs-first-implementer`
(same skill, v4 name wins). Architecture skills moved from execution-plan Phase 1 land here.
Execution-plan Phase 2 extras (`api-contract-designer`, `idempotency-first-designer`,
`validation-boundary-designer`, `observability-by-design`, `operational-runbook-author`) and
the moved arch skills (`system-context-mapper`, `bounded-context-identifier`,
`dependency-direction-guard`, `refactor-safety-planner`) are **reconciled into the Phase 2
expansion backlog** (built in Phase 8 batches, not the initial Phase 2 pass), keeping the
first pass to v4's 10 for quality.

### Phase 3 — SaaS & tenant isolation (P0/P1)
**Canonical = v4's 9:** `saas-platform-architect`, `tenant-modeler`, `tenant-isolation-reviewer`,
`multi-tenant-data-architect`, `authorization-matrix-designer`, `plan-entitlement-architect`,
`audit-log-architect`, `saas-cost-architect`, `api-event-architect`.
Execution-plan equivalents merged: `rls-policy-author`/`rls-negative-test-designer` →
**deferred to Phase 4** (RLS pack) to avoid duplication; `tenant-provisioning-designer`,
`membership-invitation-designer`, `role-permission-architect`, `security-impact-note-author`
→ Phase 3 expansion backlog.

### Phase 4 — Security, RLS & supply chain (P0/P1)
**Canonical = v4's 9:** `threat-modeler`, `appsec-implementer`, `multi-tenant-security-tester`,
`rls-policy-auditor`, `secrets-identity-hardener`, `supply-chain-security-reviewer`,
`security-pr-reviewer`, `secure-migration-reviewer`, `static-analysis-reviewer`.
Execution-plan `rls-policy-author` + `rls-negative-test-designer` **→ merged into**
`rls-policy-auditor` (which per v4 includes the negative-test plan).

### Phase 5 — QA, E2E, manual QA & evidence (P0/P1)
**Canonical = v4's 13:** `qa-strategy-architect`, `test-plan-designer`, `test-coverage-mapper`,
`qa-automation-architect`, `playwright-e2e-engineer`, `clickthrough-test-engineer`,
`manual-test-case-creator`, `screenshot-evidence-planner`, `vitest-unit-component-engineer`,
`vite-build-qa-engineer`, `flaky-test-detective`, `test-data-architect`, `regression-suite-curator`.
Execution-plan extras merged: `acceptance-criteria-tester`, `e2e-test-architect`,
`qa-closeout-reporter` → Phase 5 expansion backlog (`qa-closeout-reporter` overlaps
`ai-closeout-reporter` + `screenshot-evidence-planner`; keep as backlog to avoid trigger overlap).

> Note: execution-plan ordering placed QA at Phase 4 and audit/troubleshooting at Phase 5.
> v4 ordering (Security at 4, QA at 5) is canonical. Whole-codebase audit / troubleshooting
> skills (`full-codebase-auditor`, `principal-code-analyst`, `senior-troubleshooter`,
> `code-quality-auditor`, `dependency-license-audit-reviewer`, `code-audit-orchestrator`)
> are absorbed into v4 Phase 2 (`full-codebase-auditor`, `principal-code-analyst`) with the
> remainder in the Phase 2/5 expansion backlog.

### Phase 6 — Cloud, DevOps, reliability & release (P1)
**Canonical = v4's 10:** `cloud-architecture-decider`, `azure-saas-architect`, `aws-saas-architect`,
`iac-reviewer`, `ci-pipeline-architect`, `release-readiness-reviewer`, `rollback-runbook-author`,
`observability-operator`, `slo-reliability-architect`, `incident-response-runbook`.
Execution-plan extras (`cloud-security-baseline-reviewer`, `resilience-architecture-reviewer`,
`rollback-strategy-designer`→merged into `rollback-runbook-author`, `migration-deployment-runbook`,
`environment-parity-reviewer`, `database-backup-verifier`) → Phase 6 expansion backlog.

### Phase 7 — AI security & LLM systems (P1)
**Canonical = v4's 10:** `ai-threat-modeler`, `prompt-injection-defender`, `rag-security-architect`,
`agent-tool-safety-guard`, `llm-output-safety-reviewer`, `ai-evaluation-harness`,
`ai-cost-guardrail-designer`, `ai-governance-risk-reviewer`, `ai-router-architect`,
`structured-output-validator`.
Execution-plan extras (`ai-provider-adapter-designer`, `prompt-contract-designer`,
`ai-human-in-the-loop-designer`, `ai-autonomy-boundary-designer`, `ai-security-test-harness`→merged
into `ai-evaluation-harness`, `ai-feature-kill-switch-designer`) → Phase 7 expansion backlog.

### Phase 8 — Backlog expansion (NEW in v4, ported from execution plan §8)
Convert the remaining 300-skill roadmap into executable skills **in validated batches** under
the batch rules in §4 below. Run only after Phases 0–7 validate cleanly.

---

## 4. Ported from the execution plan into v4

### 4.1 Phase 8 batch rules (now part of canonical v4)
- **Max 20 skills per pass.**
- **Merge** duplicate/overlapping skills instead of creating noisy variants; prefer one
  strong skill over five weak ones.
- **Add `evals/trigger-evals.json`** for any skill whose description overlaps an existing skill.
- **Update README + catalog after each batch; run the validator after each batch.**
- **Create a changelog entry** per batch.
- **Stop** if generated skills become repetitive, too long, or weakly differentiated.

### 4.2 Pre-generation plan table (required before writing any skill)
Both tracks require this; it is canonical. Before creating skills in any phase, emit:

| Skill name | Category | Purpose | Trigger description | User-invocable? | Auto-invocable? | Supporting files | Eval cases |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### 4.3 Validator checks (union of both tracks — now enforced by `scripts/validate-skills.py`)
- Each skill dir has `SKILL.md`; frontmatter parses; `name` matches directory.
- `description` present and < 1024 chars.
- `SKILL.md` < 500 lines.
- No broad `allowed-tools`.
- **Catalog integrity:** every real skill is listed in `docs/skills-catalog.md` and `README.md`;
  the catalog/README claim no skills that do not exist.
- **Eval convention:** every real skill has `evals/evals.json` (structural existence + JSON parse).
- **Trigger-evals:** `evals/trigger-evals.json` is validated as JSON when present (Phase 8 requires
  it for overlapping skills).
- Bundled-name collision: no skill name shadows a reserved bundled skill name; no duplicate names.

---

## 5. Recorded decisions

- **D1 — v4 pair is canonical.** Execution plan → historical (§1).
- **D2 — Real subagents live at `.claude/agents/` with a read-only default posture.** This
  supersedes v4's earlier suggestion to store agent prompts in `docs/agents/agent-orchestrator-prompts.md`.
  The seven real subagent files ARE the agent layer; they must **not** duplicate skill bodies —
  they compose skills. Mapping from v4's orchestrator roles to the real subagents:

  | v4 orchestrator role | Real subagent (`.claude/agents/`) |
  |---|---|
  | Principal Claude Architect Agent | `principal-architecture-reviewer` |
  | SaaS Security and Tenant Isolation Agent | `secure-saas-reviewer` |
  | QA Automation and Release Evidence Agent | `qa-automation-lead` |
  | Full Codebase Audit Agent | `full-codebase-auditor` |
  | Senior Troubleshooting Agent | `senior-troubleshooting-lead` |
  | AI Security and LLM Systems Agent | `ai-security-red-team-reviewer` |
  | Release Captain Agent | `release-readiness-reviewer` |

- **D3 — Evals are a repo convention, structurally validated only.** The validator checks that
  `evals/evals.json` exists and parses (and `trigger-evals.json` parses when present). **There is
  no eval runner yet.** Building/using a runner is deferred; do not claim evals "pass," only that
  they are present and well-formed.
- **D4 — Phase 1 is the operating-discipline pack** (the 8 in §3), not the execution plan's
  architecture-heavy Phase 1. Architecture skills move to Phase 2.
- **D5 — 300-skill roadmap is the backlog/capability map, not a batch command.** Executable skills
  are built phase-by-phase; the remainder flows through Phase 8 batches.

---

## 6. Post-merge corrections

- **2026-07-07 — Phase 4 headline correction.** Squash commit `ee6515c` (PR #7) is titled "Phase 4: security & RLS pack (4 skills)" but actually delivered **all 9** canonical Phase 4 skills (`threat-modeler`, `appsec-implementer`, `multi-tenant-security-tester`, `rls-policy-auditor`, `secrets-identity-hardener`, `supply-chain-security-reviewer`, `security-pr-reviewer`, `secure-migration-reviewer`, `static-analysis-reviewer`); the stale "(4 skills)" headline was captured when auto-merge was armed on the 4-skill branch state, and the remaining 5 skills were pushed before the merge fired. `main` contains all 9 — validator reports 36 skills, exit 0.
