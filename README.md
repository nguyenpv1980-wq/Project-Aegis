# Project Aegis

**Project Aegis — Shield of the agent fleet**

*Discipline before code. Evidence before merge.*

Project Aegis is an operating system for engineering software with AI — a reusable
Claude engineering shield: a library of skills, subagents, validation gates, and
safety patterns, governed by Zero-Trust Engineering Discipline, that turns Claude
into a disciplined senior/principal engineering partner for architecture, SaaS,
security, QA, audit, troubleshooting, and AI safety.

## About

Project Aegis is a reusable Claude engineering operating system built to protect, guide,
and sharpen AI-assisted software development. It combines reusable Claude Code skills,
read-only specialist subagents, validation gates, eval conventions, and disciplined
engineering workflows so Claude operates like a senior/principal engineering partner.
The name carries three layers: the divine shield of Zeus and Athena; the Navy's Aegis,
shield of the fleet — fitting for a veteran-founded project whose operating model is a
fleet of agents; and a shield proven in use — several skills' eval cases are drawn from
real incidents this project absorbed during its own construction (an unauthorized
auto-merge, stale-memory session collisions, an empty-directory build). The goal is not
prompt bloat; it is a protected execution framework where Claude models before coding,
reads docs before implementation, tests before changes, keeps diffs small, respects
human approval boundaries, and produces evidence before closeout.

The repo is built in **phases**. **Phase 0** established the foundation — authoring
standard, templates, eval convention, validator, catalog, the seven read-only reviewer
subagents, and the Step 0 reconciliation of the two earlier planning tracks. **Phase 1**
shipped the first real skills: the 8-skill AI engineering **operating-discipline pack**
(reconciled decision D4). **Phase 2** shipped the 10-skill **core architecture &
engineering pack**. **Phase 3** shipped the 9-skill **SaaS & tenant isolation pack**.
**Phase 4** shipped the 9-skill **security, RLS & supply-chain pack**. **Phase 5**
shipped the 16-skill **QA, E2E, manual QA & evidence pack** (the 13 canonical Phase 5
skills plus 3 pulled forward from the QA backlog: roadmap #184/#185/#204). **Phase 1.5**
shipped the 4-skill **AI-SDLC governance completion** (roadmap #261/#268/#279/#280),
completing the category-08 governance layer Phase 1 started. **Phase 6** shipped the
10-skill **cloud, DevOps, reliability & release pack**. **Phase 7** shipped the
14-skill **AI security & LLM systems pack** (v4's 10 plus 4 OWASP LLM Top 10 gap
additions, D6). **Phase 7.5** shipped the **agentic AI security pack** (OWASP
Agentic Top 10 for 2026, D7: 6 new skills + 3 extensions of existing skills;
ASI08+ASI10 merged into one containment reviewer). The **Compliance &
Governance batch** (D9) ships the 9-skill **compliance pack** — ISO
27001:2022 + ISO 42001:2023 + SOC 2 with NIST AI RMF as companion: one
shared control foundation + framework projections + a crosswalk, mapping
controls that largely already exist and producing auditor-grade evidence on
top. The first **D13 library-meta pull** (D18) ships `skill-quality-reviewer`
— the judgment layer atop the mechanical validator, so the library now
reviews its own additions. The **D13 completion** (D22) ships the remaining
four library-meta skills — `library-diff-reviewer`, `eval-runner-designer`,
`skill-usage-instrumenter`, and `skill-deprecation-planner` — so the library
also reviews its own PRs end-to-end, holds an execution design for its
evals, can measure which skills actually fire, and can retire a skill as
deliberately as it ships one. The **D12.8 operational workflow patterns pack**
(D21) ships the 10 evidence-extracted skills that are the concrete, invocable
rules of the Zero-Trust Engineering Discipline (D16) — approval registers,
governed standing approval, chat-backlog reconciliation, the context
co-update CI gate, lane guides, the local CI mirror preflight, risk-tiered
validation, sharded validation with resume, merge-is-deploy governance, and
the gated deployment prompt template. The **data/performance/QA-validation
batch** (D23) ships three packs at once: the 7-skill **D12.1 data engineering
pack** (schema evolution, the internal streaming backbone, data-quality
monitoring, the operational/analytical split, the warehouse/lake estate, PII
lifecycle, and data-migration runbooks), the 6-skill **D12.3 performance
engineering pack** (profiling methodology, query-plan reading, N+1
detection, caching strategy, latency budgets, and frontend performance), and
the 2-skill **D10 Tier 1 performance/load validation pair**
(`performance-test-harness` + `load-test-planner`) — closing the QA
roadmap's headline gap, with the seam pinned both ways: D12.3 designs FOR
performance, D10 measures it — see
[Skills (shipped)](#skills-shipped) below. The **product/PM/growth batch**
(D24) ships three more packs: the 5-skill **D12.2 product-engineering
craft pack** (pagination cursors, error taxonomies, edge-state UX,
notification/webhook UX, mobile viewport craft), the 6-skill **D12.5
PM/product-engineering interface pack** (requirements facilitation,
product specs, uncertainty-aware roadmaps, prioritization frames,
feature-flag rollout, and product-sunset communication), and the 4-skill
**D12.6 growth/analytics engineering pack** (the analytics event schema,
funnel definitions, A/B testing, and product-analytics instrumentation) —
with `product-spec-writer`≠`adr-writer` and
`sunset-deprecation-communicator`≠`skill-deprecation-planner` pinned hard,
plus the two three-way event/analytics seams. The **docs-engineering
batch** (D25, PART A of a two-PR set) ships the 8-skill **D12.4 technical
writing / docs engineering pack** (README craft, ADR-corpus sequencing,
Diátaxis organization, the docs-as-code pipeline, generated API reference,
contribution guides, new-hire onboarding, and doc-retention governance) —
`adr-sequencer` extends `adr-writer`, `docs-retention-index` is the
doc-lifecycle counterpart to `skill-deprecation-planner` (pinned both
ways), and `api-doc-generator-designer` documents the contract
`api-event-architect` owns. The **staff-IC / architecture /
framework-refresh batch** (D26, PART B of the same set) ships the 7-skill
**D12.7 staff+ IC craft pack** (tech specs, design-review facilitation,
cross-team dependency negotiation, roadmap-to-commitments translation,
staff scope selection, promotion packets, and phased-work handoffs), the
1-skill **D12.9 architecture-advisory pack** (`architecture-advisor` — the
STYLE/paradigm advisor), and the 3-skill **D14 framework-refresh /
source-currency pack** (`framework-edition-tracker` →
`framework-mapping-refresher`, plus `source-currency-auditor`) that keeps
the library current with external truth without ever auto-updating a
mapping. The **OWASP web-app gap-closure pair** (D28) closes the last two
zero-coverage categories from the D8 OWASP Top 10:2025 audit:
`security-logging-alerting-architect` (A09 — security-event detection
coverage, alerting rules, response wiring) and
`error-handling-security-reviewer` (A10 — fail-closed defaults, error-path
authorization, exception-driven bypass, leak-free error responses) — all 10
OWASP web-app categories now have at least one owning skill.

## What this is

Aegis is not just a collection of skills; it is an **operating system for engineering
software with AI**. It combines (a) a library of ready-to-use skills an AI coding
assistant follows, (b) read-only specialist reviewers that give independent second
opinions, (c) validation gates and eval conventions that check the work mechanically,
and (d) — governing all of it — **Zero-Trust Engineering Discipline**, the doctrine
that decides how everything above is allowed to operate.

The discipline's essence in one line: **"Never trust, always verify — every step of the
lifecycle. Assume drift. Demand evidence. Track everything."** It is documented at
[docs/ZERO_TRUST_ENGINEERING_DISCIPLINE.md](docs/ZERO_TRUST_ENGINEERING_DISCIPLINE.md)
and deliberately extends the Zero Trust security principle from network access to the
whole development lifecycle. The problem it solves: AI assistants confidently act on
stale memory, claim done-when-not-done, and let docs drift away from the code — this
system replaces that risk with enforced evidence at every step.

## How to use this

**Point an AI coding assistant at the repo.** The skills live under
[`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/); point the assistant at this repository (or copy
the skill directories into your own project) and it picks them up from there. Skills
are invoked by their trigger descriptions — each skill's frontmatter states when it
applies, so the assistant selects the right procedure from the task itself.
[`docs/skill-generation-standard.md`](docs/skill-generation-standard.md) defines the
format.

**Run the core loop.** Every change, large or small, follows the same rhythm:

1. **Classify the change** — what kind of change is this, and what validation and
   approval path does that class require?
2. **Verify against evidence** — run the checks; never assume state from memory.
3. **Keep the diff small and reviewable** — one intent, exact files, nothing smuggled in.
4. **A human approves the merge** — the assistant proposes; a person decides.
5. **Record the decision** — a dated entry in the planning record, so history never
   drifts.

This loop is not overhead layered on top of the discipline; it **is** the discipline in
practice.

**Follow the non-negotiable operating rules** (full text with rationales in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)): evidence before merge; one session per repo at a
time; no auto-merge — the human is the gate; and every decision tracked as a dated
entry in the reconciliation doc.

**What a change looks like.** One realistic pass through the loop:

> A developer asks for a new feature. The assistant classifies the change and locks the
> scope, then composes the relevant shipped skills — say, domain modeling, test-first
> implementation, and a security review matching the change class. It produces a small
> diff with passing tests as evidence and opens a pull request, which the validator
> gates in CI. A human reviews and merges. The decision lands as a dated entry in the
> planning record.

## Map of the system

- **Skills** ([`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/)) — the ~161 shipped procedures,
  grouped by the phase categories in the catalog: operating discipline, AI-SDLC
  governance, core architecture & engineering, SaaS & tenant isolation, security &
  supply chain, QA & evidence, cloud & reliability & release, AI/LLM security, agentic
  AI security, compliance & governance, library meta (self-application), the
  D12.8 operational workflow patterns (the Zero-Trust Engineering Discipline's
  concrete rules), data engineering (D12.1), performance engineering (D12.3),
  and performance/load validation (D10 Tier 1). Full list in
  [Skills (shipped)](#skills-shipped) below.
- **Subagents** — seven read-only specialist reviewers, one per lens; see
  [Subagents (read-only reviewers)](#subagents-read-only-reviewers).
- **The planning record**
  ([`docs/reconciliation/step-0-reconciliation-v4.md`](docs/reconciliation/step-0-reconciliation-v4.md))
  — the dated decisions (D1–D22) in §5 are the project's immutable decision log; the
  D12/D14 candidate scopes recorded there are banked-but-not-built future
  work (the D12.8 pack graduated from banked to built with D21; the D13
  library-meta scope completed with D22).
- **The doctrine**
  ([docs/ZERO_TRUST_ENGINEERING_DISCIPLINE.md](docs/ZERO_TRUST_ENGINEERING_DISCIPLINE.md))
  and **the operating rules** ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)) — why the system
  works this way, and the eight enforceable rules every session follows.
- **Validation + CI** — the local structural gate ([Validation](#validation)) and the
  merge gate ([CI (merge gate)](#ci-merge-gate)).

## Subagents (read-only reviewers)

Real project subagents live under `.claude/agents/<name>.md` (reconciled decision D2),
read-only by default. Each maps to a v4 orchestrator role (see reconciliation §5):

| Subagent | Lens |
|---|---|
| `principal-architecture-reviewer` | Architecture boundaries, coupling, data ownership, scalability. |
| `secure-saas-reviewer` | Tenant isolation, RLS, authz, secrets, cross-tenant leakage. |
| `qa-automation-lead` | Test strategy, coverage gaps, flake risk, release evidence. |
| `full-codebase-auditor` | Whole-repo inventory, evidence-based risk, debt map. |
| `senior-troubleshooting-lead` | Reproduction, hypothesis ranking, root cause. |
| `ai-security-red-team-reviewer` | Prompt injection, tool/RAG abuse, data exfil. |
| `release-readiness-reviewer` | CI/build/test evidence, migrations, rollback, go/no-go. |

## Skills (shipped)

Phase 1 — AI engineering operating-discipline pack, under `.claude/skills/<name>/`
(full detail: [`docs/skills-catalog.md`](docs/skills-catalog.md)):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-startup-context-gate` | Verifies repo identity and loads governing context before any work; halts when the location can't be verified (a path that exists is not proof it's the right repo). | auto + manual |
| `source-of-truth-reconciler` | Resolves conflicts between instructions, docs, code, tests, and memory by evidence-cited precedence; surfaces every assumption. | auto + manual |
| `change-classification-gate` | Classifies a change before work → validation floor + approval path; locks scope to the approved class. | auto + manual |
| `human-approval-boundary` | Halts for explicit approval before schema, RLS/security, prod-data, secrets, deploy, billing, or destructive work; stops when security impact is unclear. | auto + manual |
| `reviewable-diff-discipline` | Keeps diffs small and intentional; stages exact files only; staged set must equal declared intent. | auto + manual |
| `ai-closeout-reporter` | Terminal closeout report with a mandatory "intentionally not done / omitted" section — scope reductions are never silent. | auto + manual |
| `agent-failure-recovery` | Preserve-first recovery from broken git/tree state; destructive cleanup only with backup + explicit approval. | **manual only** |
| `agent-instruction-consolidator` | Aligns CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / Cursor / Copilot instruction files to one canonical source with rule-preservation proof. | **manual only** |

Phase 1.5 — AI-SDLC governance completion (roadmap #261/#268/#279/#280; completes the
category-08 layer Phase 1 started — composes the Phase 1 skills, never restates them):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-sdlc-operating-model` | End-to-end human+agent lifecycle contract: named stages with entry/exit gates, per-stage authority (human / agent / agent-with-approval), enforcing skill per stage, failure routing, learning loop; grounded in observed PR practice with a gap list. | auto + manual |
| `agent-authorization-matrix` | Deny-by-default action × context matrix of standing agent authority — merge to protected branches requires a named human always; auto-merge arming is forbidden to agents (armed state re-checked after every push); approval scope/expiry semantics; proposal-first. | **manual only** |
| `agent-memory-governance` | Persistent-memory WRITE/TRUST/HYGIENE rules: confirmed durable facts with provenance and absolute dates, never secrets; remembered repo/PR state verified against live git/gh before acting; disposition-approved cleanups. | **manual only** |
| `agent-governance-audit` | Audits one AI-assisted change's process compliance from primary evidence (PR timeline incl. who armed auto-merge, commits, CI runs): per-control PASS/FAIL/UNVERIFIABLE verdicts; closeout claims cross-checked; missing evidence is never a PASS. | auto + manual |

Phase 2 — core architecture & engineering pack:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `domain-modeler` | Domain model from requirements/code — language, bounded contexts, aggregates with invariants; hard "do not code yet" gate at the end. | auto + manual |
| `architecture-designer` | Inspects the CURRENT architecture first, then component/dependency/data-ownership maps, tradeoffs, ADR draft, and an incremental migration plan. | auto + manual |
| `adr-writer` | Architecture Decision Records with honest alternatives, consequences, operational impact, mandatory rollback/reversal plan and review date. | auto + manual |
| `docs-first-implementer` | Pins the exact installed library version (lockfile), reads version-matching docs before coding, verifies with real commands; declares uncertainty instead of guessing. | auto + manual |
| `tdd-engineer` | Strict red-green-refactor: confirms each test fails for the intended reason before the minimal implementation; reports exact commands and results. | auto + manual |
| `systematic-debugger` | Reproduce → reduce → isolate → fix one thing → verify → prevent; prediction-tested hypotheses, single-variable fixes, regression test kept. | auto + manual |
| `code-reviewer` | Reviews actual diffs only — severity-ranked findings with file:line evidence and remediation; no diff, no review. | auto + manual |
| `code-simplifier` | Behavior-preserving simplification with the suite green before and after every move; coverage gate; restraint ("not done" list) is a deliverable. | **manual only** |
| `principal-code-analyst` | Subsystem-level strategic analysis laddering code findings to architecture, security, cost; risk register + small-step remediation with validation signals. | auto + manual |
| `full-codebase-auditor` | Whole-repo audit with inventory-first coverage; findings filed as confirmed / likely / hypotheses / missing information. (Skill = procedure; same-named subagent composes it.) | auto + manual |

Phase 3 — SaaS & tenant isolation pack:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `saas-platform-architect` | Platform structure: per-component pooled/siloed/bridge decisions with named isolation mechanisms, control-plane/data-plane split, capability inventory, rollout plan with per-step rollback. | auto + manual |
| `tenant-modeler` | Tenant semantics: definition, hierarchy, membership-as-entity (roles on membership), invitations, ownership, and a lifecycle state machine with per-state access/data/billing/jobs posture. | auto + manual |
| `tenant-isolation-reviewer` | Reviews real systems for cross-tenant leakage across all 15 surfaces (identity → audit, incl. AI retrieval); evidence-cited findings, isolation test matrix, negative tests, honest not-inspected list. | auto + manual |
| `multi-tenant-data-architect` | Per-store tenant scoping decisions (incl. caches, search, vector stores), server-derived tenant-context propagation, ownership map, expand→contract migration with verification and rollback. | auto + manual |
| `authorization-matrix-designer` | Deny-by-default roles × permissions × resources matrix, object-level rules, enforcement-point map, brokered support access, negative tests, additive role migration. | auto + manual |
| `plan-entitlement-architect` | Plan × entitlement matrix with one resolution point enforced uniformly on every surface; metering hooks; plan transitions with no silent data loss; grandfathering + rollback. | auto + manual |
| `audit-log-architect` | Audit event taxonomy, versioned record schema, append-only integrity with explicit write-failure policy, retention/redaction, tenant-scoped access, negative tests. | auto + manual |
| `saas-cost-architect` | Bill-grounded cost drivers, per-tenant attribution (or admitted overhead), distribution-based unit economics vs revenue, exposure math, guardrails with observe-first rollout. | auto + manual |
| `api-event-architect` | External API/event contracts: credential-derived tenant context, idempotency, per-tenant/plan rate limits, versioning with dual-run deprecation, tenant-scoped signed webhooks. | auto + manual |

Phase 4 — security, RLS & supply-chain pack:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `threat-modeler` | Design-time threat model: assets/actors/trust-boundaries, STRIDE per boundary, abuse cases, exploit-path-gated severity, mitigations mapped to negative tests; consumes tenant/authz outputs instead of re-deriving them. | auto + manual |
| `appsec-implementer` | Implements one NAMED security control test-first — negative test red→green, minimal server-side control, scoped diff, residual risk stated. | **manual only** |
| `multi-tenant-security-tester` | Executable cross-tenant/authorization negative suite: two-tenant fixtures, forbidden-action-denied assertions, positive controls, IDOR/list/mass-assignment/exports/jobs, honest coverage. | auto + manual |
| `rls-policy-auditor` | Per-command RLS audit/authoring (merges rls-policy-author + rls-negative-test-designer): recursion, unsafe SECURITY DEFINER, broad grants, missing tenant scope, service-role leakage, frontend-derived scope; mandatory negative-test plan; policies delivered as a migration, never run live. | auto + manual |
| `secrets-identity-hardener` | Env classification (catches VITE_/NEXT_PUBLIC_ leaks), moves secrets server-side with a client-bundle-absence proof, rotates leaked credentials, least-privilege service accounts, session/token flags. | **manual only** |
| `supply-chain-security-reviewer` | SLSA-style: lockfile-based dependency set, reachability triage of scanner output, install/build-script and CI compromise paths, SHA pinning, compromise-path-gated severity. | auto + manual |
| `security-pr-reviewer` | Security lens on an actual diff: authz/object-level/tenant-scope, injection, secrets, SSRF, control-weakening detection; exploit-path-gated findings; no diff, no review. | auto + manual |
| `secure-migration-reviewer` | Whole-migration deploy safety: RLS/policy gaps, GRANT widening, unsafe defaults, destructive/irreversible ops, tenant-scoped backfills, lock risk, expand→contract deploy order, rollback; delegates policy text to `rls-policy-auditor`. | auto + manual |
| `static-analysis-reviewer` | Triages SAST/CodeQL/SARIF on first-party code: dedup, confirm-against-code disposition (TP/FP/dup/accepted), five-axis ranking (reachability/exploitability/asset/tenant/business), written suppression policy. | auto + manual |

Phase 5 — QA, E2E, manual QA & evidence pack (13 canonical + 3 pulled forward from the
QA backlog, roadmap #184/#185/#204):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `qa-strategy-architect` | Product-level QA strategy: ranked risk inventory → cheapest-reliable-layer decisions, explicit automation/manual split, evidence per change class, CI gates, ownership. | auto + manual |
| `test-plan-designer` | Per-change test plan: risk-traced items with layer/data/environment, objective entry/exit criteria, named artifacts and CI placement, explicit out-of-scope list. | auto + manual |
| `test-coverage-mapper` | Coverage audit: surface inventory first, maps tests by reading assertions (theater ≠ coverage), risk-ranked gaps with cheapest fill layer, honest not-inspected list. | auto + manual |
| `qa-automation-architect` | Automation blueprint: tools per layer with rationale, structure/fixtures/auth-state, parallel-safe isolation, CI tiers with bounded logged retries, flake policy, migration steps. | auto + manual |

| `integration-test-designer` | (pulled forward, #184) The layer between unit and E2E: real service/command/DB/auth/permission boundaries, named faked seams, persisted-state assertions, no browser. | auto + manual |
| `api-contract-test-designer` | (pulled forward, #185) Contract verification: provider/consumer roles, schema + error-envelope validation, additive-vs-breaking CI gate, version coverage; design stays with `api-event-architect`. | auto + manual |

Phase 6 — cloud, DevOps, reliability & release pack (`rollback-strategy-designer`
merged into `rollback-runbook-author` per reconciliation §3):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `cloud-architecture-decider` | Cloud-neutral platform decision: nine-axis requirements record, provider-neutral logical architecture, isolation/compliance hard filters before scoring, managed-vs-self-hosted with the operational bill, exit costs and reopen triggers. | auto + manual |
| `azure-saas-architect` | Maps a decided logical architecture to provider-idiomatic Azure: Entra ID/managed identities/OIDC, VNets + Private Link, per-store tenant isolation, compute by team maturity, Azure Policy/Defender posture, Bicep/Terraform, tag-keyed cost controls; SKU/limit/price claims become verification items. | auto + manual |

Phase 7 — AI security & LLM systems pack (14 = v4's 10 + 4 OWASP LLM Top 10 gap
additions, D6). Anchored to the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025); these
skills **compose** the shipped tenant/security/cost/governance packs rather than
re-deriving them. **LLM03** is extend-existing (the shipped
`supply-chain-security-reviewer` was extended to models/datasets/adapters);
**LLM10** DoS/denial-of-wallet is baked into `ai-cost-guardrail-designer`;
`ai-evaluation-harness` absorbs the AI security test harness:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-threat-modeler` | AI-specific threat model: AI assets + trust boundaries (all untrusted content), per-boundary threats anchored to the OWASP LLM Top 10, abuse cases, exploit-path-gated severity, each mitigation mapped to an owning skill + red-team case; composes `threat-modeler` for the classic surface. | auto + manual |
| `prompt-injection-defender` | Layered injection defense (LLM01): trust zones, the untrusted-content invariant, content/instruction separation, and the primary layer — deterministic action authorization OUTSIDE the model; direct + indirect payloads; red-team suite with SAFE-outcome assertions. | **manual only** |
| `rag-security-architect` | RAG/vector-store security (LLM08): authorization AT RETRIEVAL TIME (never post-filter), per-tenant index scoping, document-ACL propagation, embedding risks (inversion/membership/poisoning/stale-permission); composes `tenant-isolation-reviewer` + `multi-tenant-data-architect`. | auto + manual |
| `agent-tool-safety-guard` | Least-privilege tool access (LLM06): per-tool blast-radius matrix, calling-user authority (no service-account confused deputy), argument validation before execution, approval gates on irreversible actions, tool-chain abuse; composes `human-approval-boundary` + `agent-authorization-matrix`. | auto + manual |
| `llm-output-safety-reviewer` | Output-handling review (LLM05): model output as untrusted data to render/execute/URL/tool/store sinks (XSS/RCE/SSRF/injection/second-order), context-correct encoding, generated-code sandboxing; exploit-flow-gated findings. | auto + manual |
| `ai-evaluation-harness` | Versioned eval dataset (representative + adversarial/red-team + regression), per-dimension graders + thresholds (quality/schema/safety/grounding/injection/latency/cost), CI regression gate; absorbs the AI security test harness; honest real-run reporting. | **manual only** |

| `structured-output-validator` | Output-shape contract (LLM05 companion): schema (fields/types/enums/ranges), validate-before-use, semantic checks beyond shape (tenant-scoped ids), bounded failure handling; shape-is-not-safety handoffs to `llm-output-safety-reviewer` + `agent-tool-safety-guard`. | auto + manual |
| `sensitive-disclosure-guard` | (NEW, LLM02) Disclosure defense: data-minimization + pre-model redaction of secrets/PII/other-tenant data, output-path echo/bleed checks, log redaction at emission, provider retention/training posture; composes `tenant-isolation-reviewer` + `secrets-identity-hardener`. | auto + manual |
| `model-poisoning-reviewer` | (NEW, LLM04) Training/feedback/ingestion integrity: contributor-trust assessment, poisoning paths, feedback-loop Sybil defense, ingestion-as-truth integrity, provenance/holdout controls; acquire-vs-ingest boundary with `supply-chain-security-reviewer`. | auto + manual |
| `system-prompt-leakage-reviewer` | (NEW, LLM07) Two axes: no secrets in the prompt AND no security dependence on prompt secrecy — **system prompts are NOT security controls**; enforcement is deterministic and lives OUTSIDE the LLM; extraction-is-harmless framing. | auto + manual |
| `ai-misinformation-guard` | (NEW, LLM09) Grounding in retrieved sources (not memory), citation-to-claim verification, calibrated uncertainty/refusal, fact validation before action, package/API hallucination (slopsquatting) checks, overreliance-aware UX. | auto + manual |

Phase 7.5 — agentic AI security pack (6 new + 3 extensions). Anchored to the
OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026), ASI01–ASI10, per reconciliation
§3 (D7). The Agentic Top 10 **extends** the LLM Top 10: agent systems inherit
every Phase 7 risk; this pack adds autonomy, tool, identity, memory, and
multi-agent risks on top. **ASI08+ASI10 merged** into one
`agent-containment-reviewer` (D7). **Extensions (scoped diffs, not new
skills):** `agent-tool-safety-guard` extended for ASI02 + the tool-side slice
of ASI05 (tool misuse, side-effect limits, code-execution tool class);
`llm-output-safety-reviewer` extended for ASI05 (autonomous generate-and-run
loops, ephemeral sandboxes, NL-to-execution paths);
`supply-chain-security-reviewer` extended again (after D6/LLM03) for ASI04
(MCP servers/manifests, tool/skill registries, plugins, A2A dependencies):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-goal-hijack-defender` | (ASI01) Goal/plan integrity for multi-step agents: pinned goal record outside the model context, principal-only mutation channel, per-step tracing, deviation detection, drift response, per-channel hijack red-team suite; builds on `prompt-injection-defender` (LLM01 owns the vector). | **manual only** |
| `agent-identity-privilege-reviewer` | (ASI03) Agent identity architecture: distinct least-privilege identity per agent, task/time-scoped credentials, delegation chains that attenuate (never amplify), confused-deputy closure, dual attribution (principal + agent); complements `secrets-identity-hardener`. | auto + manual |
| `memory-context-poisoning-reviewer` | (ASI06) Persistent memory poisoning review: write-path trust, validation-before-write, provenance, tenant/user/session scoping at write AND recall, TTL + purge with rollback, recalled memory as data never instructions; distinct from `model-poisoning-reviewer` (LLM04) and `rag-security-architect` (LLM08). | auto + manual |
| `inter-agent-comms-reviewer` | (ASI07) A2A/MCP message security: per-edge mutual authn, end-to-end integrity, replay bounds, confidentiality, topology allowlists, spoofed results; authenticated ≠ trusted — peer messages never re-task or assert authority. | auto + manual |
| `agent-containment-reviewer` | (ASI08+ASI10 merged) Cascade half: blast-radius isolation, bounded upstream trust, circuit breakers, checkpoints/rollback, retry-storm limits. Rogue half: drift baselines, agent inventory/lifecycle, kill switches that SEVER AUTHORITY (credentials revoked, not processes killed); composes `ai-cost-guardrail-designer` + `incident-response-runbook`. | auto + manual |
| `human-agent-trust-reviewer` | (ASI09) Adversarial review of the approval layer: consent fatigue (rate/latency signals), self-reported summaries vs system-verified facts, bundling, urgency manipulation, automation-bias controls; counterpart to `human-approval-boundary`. | auto + manual |

Compliance & Governance batch (D9) — ISO 27001:2022 + ISO 42001:2023 + SOC 2,
with NIST AI RMF 1.0 as voluntary companion. Architecture: **one shared
control foundation + framework projections + a crosswalk** — not three
parallel skill sets. The batch **maps controls that largely already exist**
(Phases 3/4 technical controls, the Phase 5 evidence pack, Phase 1.5 +
Phase 7 AI governance) and produces auditor-grade evidence on top. Every
skill encodes the D9 precision flags (SOC 2 = AICPA **attestation**, never
certification; Annex A counts secondary-sourced/conflicting — verify before
citing; ~60–80% overlap = industry estimate) in a Compliance Precision
Rules section:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `compliance-control-foundation` | One framework-agnostic control catalog (access control, crypto, change mgmt, logging/monitoring, incident response, vendor mgmt, risk assessment + AI governance): each control written once with objective, owner, mechanism mapped by name to shipped skills, evidence hook, honest status. | auto + manual |
| `compliance-evidence-collector` | Operating-effectiveness evidence OVER TIME (SOC 2 Type 2's core demand, reused for ISO surveillance): per-control cadence matched to operating frequency, populations for sampling, retention/integrity, window-coverage matrix with holes; never mutates a live evidence store. | auto + manual |
| `statement-of-applicability-author` | The ISO-mandatory SoA serving both 27001 and 42001: per-control include/exclude justified by 6.1.3 risk-treatment traces, controlled-document diffs, licensed-Annex-A-only rows — never reconstructed from memory. | auto + manual |
| `iso-27001-isms-architect` | ISMS clauses 4–10 (incl. Amd 1:2024 climate-relevance check), four-theme Annex A selection via the foundation; headline net-new = risk register, internal audit program, management review cadence; readiness plan, never a certification claim. | auto + manual |
| `iso-42001-aims-architect` | AIMS clauses 4–10 + AI risk assessment (6.1.2/8.2), AI risk treatment (6.1.3/8.3), AI system impact assessment (6.1.4/8.4 — individuals/societies); maps the Phase 1.5 governance pack as operational mechanisms; Annex A counts never stated (sources conflict). | auto + manual |
| `soc2-trust-criteria-mapper` | SOC 2 scoping as ATTESTATION (never certification): system boundary, commitment-driven TSC category selection (Security baseline + optional four), Type 1 vs Type 2 with window feasibility, subservice carve-outs; Type definitions flagged CPA-firm-sourced. | auto + manual |
| `multi-framework-crosswalk` | One control → 27001 Annex A + SOC 2 TSC + 42001 Annex A (+ AI RMF function): edition-pinned, text-in-hand cells only, FULL/PARTIAL(residue) honesty, explicit joint sets — the do-the-work-once engine. | auto + manual |
| `compliance-gap-auditor` | ONE parameterized gap audit vs chosen framework(s): MET/PARTIAL/GAP/UNVERIFIABLE per requirement from cited evidence (missing evidence is never MET), blockers-first remediation order; readiness assessment, never an audit opinion. | auto + manual |
| `ai-lifecycle-risk-manager` | NIST AI RMF GOVERN/MAP/MEASURE/MANAGE operationalized across the AI lifecycle with owners, triggers, and a risk register; voluntary and under revision — never a certification target; companion to `iso-42001-aims-architect`. | auto + manual |

D13 — library meta / self-application (D18 + D22): the library applies its
own discipline to itself, end to end. All five are pure review/design
skills (verdicts, specs, plans — none edits anything) → model-invocable.
`skill-quality-reviewer` **composes** `scripts/validate-skills.py` as its
entry gate; `library-diff-reviewer` composes `skill-quality-reviewer` as
its single-skill inner loop (the seam pinned at D18, now owned from both
sides); `skill-usage-instrumenter` produces the evidence package
`skill-deprecation-planner` consumes; `docs-retention-index` (the
DOC-lifecycle twin, D12.4) stays banked with the SKILL-vs-DOC seam pinned
in trigger-evals:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `skill-quality-reviewer` | The judgment layer above the mechanical validator: validator-first gate, then the seven checks it cannot script — trigger quality (trigger-oriented vs merely descriptive), trigger collision against the full shipped corpus (colliding skills NAMED), duplication/extension (the LLM03/ASI04 precedent), eval integrity (boundary cases vs hollow filler), section substance (Stop Conditions that actually refuse), scope discipline, invocation posture. Per-check PASS/CONCERN/FAIL with quoted evidence → ship / revise / reject / make-it-an-extension. | auto + manual |
| `library-diff-reviewer` | Reviews a whole library-changing PR end-to-end: fresh validator evidence pinned to the PR head, registration consistency (placement, post-merge voice, banked-candidate graduation, count arithmetic at every site), collision sweep against the shipped corpus AND in-batch siblings, diff coherence, per-skill quality via `skill-quality-reviewer` as the inner loop → one approve/request-changes verdict; performs no platform action (no merge, no auto-merge arming). | auto + manual |
| `eval-runner-designer` | Designs how the eval corpus would actually EXECUTE — per-case-type semantics (fresh isolated session; refusal cases fire AND refuse), pairwise discrimination scoring, deterministic-vs-LLM-judge assertion routing with JUDGE-ERROR honesty, UNRUN-default reporting, cost/sampling tiers, flake policy, advisory-first CI. Design/spec only: never claims a runner exists or that evals pass. | auto + manual |
| `skill-usage-instrumenter` | Designs the usage-evidence layer: invocation signals (auto vs explicit, coarse enums — never prompt content or user identifiers), wrong-fire/correction events, never-fired lists over a stated window, evidence tiers, thresholds naming an action AND consumer, and the rare-but-critical exemption so low usage alone never condemns a safety-net skill. Adds no hooks; edits nothing. | auto + manual |
| `skill-deprecation-planner` | Plans a skill's staged retirement: qualifying trigger (superseded + coverage diff / absorbed / evidenced disuse / defect), reverse-link sweep with a disposition per inbound reference, mark → redirect-window → remove with rollback per stage (squash removal reverts as one ordinary commit), registration rows moved to a retired record. Plan only; every stage is human-approved. | auto + manual |

D12.8 — operational workflow patterns (D21): the 10 evidence-extracted
patterns from the read-only audit of two production multi-agent repositories
([extraction report](docs/research/aegis-workflow-extraction-report.md)) —
the concrete, invocable rules of the
[Zero-Trust Engineering Discipline](docs/ZERO_TRUST_ENGINEERING_DISCIPLINE.md)
(D16), product-agnostic with identifiers templated as placeholders:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `scoped-approval-register` | Durable append-style record of every granted approval — Status / Reason / Scope allowed / Scope FORBIDDEN / Evidence — with supersede-never-rewrite lifecycle and deny-by-default citation; composes `human-approval-boundary` (which decides WHERE approval is required). | auto + manual |
| `standing-approval-and-auto-advance` | Governed anti-approval-fatigue: named-scope standing approval for the mechanical loop, phase-advance only into already-approved phases, per-session restatement, explicit opt-out, reviewer-block path; merge-after-green strictly opt-in (never default); never covers protected-branch merge or arming auto-merge — rationale anchored to the ungoverned-auto-merge incident. | **manual only** |
| `chat-backlog-reconciliation` | Cadenced extraction of chat-only decisions/bugs/backlog into dated repo docs, each item audited against PR/source evidence (completed/partial/active/not-active/unknown); chat "done" caps at unknown without repo proof. | auto + manual |
| `context-co-update-ci-gate` | CI gate failing PRs that touch important paths without a context-map update (declared, reviewable no-op hatch — never silent) + the honest-update protocol (date+SHA stamps, evidence-only status moves, risk notes never deleted without proof); write-back half of `agent-startup-context-gate`. | auto + manual |
| `lane-authoring-guide` | Pre-work, evidence-cited guide per parallel agent lane — lifecycle slice, contracts, per-unit recipe/checklist, explicit "must NOT do" boundary; mutually exclusive lanes; authored at work's BEGINNING (the closeout owns the end). | auto + manual |
| `local-ci-mirror-preflight` | Per-commit CI mirror: derive local equivalents of every PR-triggered check from workflow files, baseline on clean mainline first (separate git worktree), classify failures PR-caused / pre-existing / CI-infra / cannot-determine; declared docs-only path. | auto + manual |
| `risk-tiered-validation-selector` | Fail-closed classifier: changed files → validation depth (docs-only / fast / full) with never-docs-only + forced-full lists, max-over-files aggregation, diffable rules; routes validation COST where `change-classification-gate` routes APPROVAL. | auto + manual |
| `sharded-validation-with-resume` | Full tier as named functional shards: persisted status (failed ≠ interrupted), resume only past timeout/infra interruptions (never past real failures), empty-or-fail uncategorized catch-shard, ONE aggregate gate as the sole required check. | auto + manual |
| `merge-is-deploy-governance` | Standing governance for merge==deploy platforms: documented reality, PR validation as the authoritative gate, post-merge demoted to verification, branch protection recorded in-repo (human-only changes), stated exposure window, revert-PR rollback with strategy-correct mechanics. | auto + manual |
| `gated-deployment-prompt-template` | Reusable operator prompt for recurring risky ops: placeholders only, hard rules with required inputs, stop conditions with safe halt states, backup-then-verify gating, per-phase smoke expectations, required per-run report, history-index-anchored ETAs; uncited claims labeled "unverified". | auto + manual |

D12.1 — data engineering pack (D23): multi-tenant operational + analytical
data as a first-class discipline; the internal-pipeline-vs-external-contract
seam against `api-event-architect` is pinned both ways:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `schema-evolution-planner` | Staged expand→migrate→contract plans for live-store schema change: per-stage old×new compatibility guarantees, consumer enumeration incl. events and analytics extracts, verification gates, deprecation register, rollback per stage; runbook and safety review handed off. | auto + manual |
| `streaming-event-architect` | INTERNAL event/stream backbone: per-flow stream-vs-queue, keys with honest ordering scope, at-least-once + idempotent consumers ("exactly-once" interrogated), DLQ with owner and replay, retention vs compaction, event-schema compatibility, CDC; external webhooks/feeds stay with `api-event-architect`. | auto + manual |
| `data-quality-monitor-designer` | Data-content checks across six dimensions placed at ingest/transform/serving, each with severity, owner, and block/quarantine/alert-and-pass — never silent auto-fix; per-dataset quality SLAs; wiring handed to `observability-operator`. | auto + manual |
| `operational-vs-analytical-splitter` | Decides which workloads leave the transactional store and how (replica / CDC / materialized views / cache) against owner-stated freshness tolerance, with the one-bad-query escape, a stop-doing list with enforcement, and staged cutover. | auto + manual |
| `warehouse-lake-architect` | Analytical estate design: warehouse/lake/lakehouse by workload and team maturity, zones with contracts, modeling + SCD policy per mart, tenant key mandatory in every zone, PII per lifecycle rules, catalog governance, cost posture. | auto + manual |
| `pii-lifecycle-designer` | Personal-data lifecycle estate-wide: classification, per-store data map incl. logs/caches/vector stores/backups/vendors, minimization, retention with mechanics, propagating erasure with an honest backup stance, re-identification checks, residency. | auto + manual |
| `data-migration-runbook-author` | Operator-executable data-move runbooks: plan + safety review + VERIFIED backup as prerequisites, signal-tuned batching with idempotent resume, per-batch verification with expected outputs, numeric abort criteria naming safe halt states, human-approved no-return points. Authors documents; executes nothing. | auto + manual |

D12.3 — performance engineering pack (D23): these skills design FOR
performance; the D10 pair below MEASURES it (seam pinned both sides):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `profiling-methodology-designer` | Where-does-time-go methodology: attribution level first (low utilization = waiting → off-CPU), measurement conditions with an overhead budget, narrowing loop with stop rule and ruled-out register, handoff map to the narrow tools. Production attach approval-gated; fixes nothing. | auto + manual |
| `query-plan-reader` | ONE query's plan → ranked verdict: dominant cost node, estimate-vs-actual divergence first, sargability rewrites, composite indexes priced in write amplification, tenant/row-security predicate cost read, re-verification at representative volume. | auto + manual |
| `n-plus-one-detector` | Chatty data-access patterns (N+1, repeated identical, serial awaits, over-fetch) evidenced by per-request counts, fixed by pattern with request-scoped loaders (a tenant-leak boundary), guarded by query-count budgets in tests; refuses the cache-the-storm reflex. | auto + manual |
| `caching-strategy-designer` | What/where/how-it-stays-correct caching: written consistency envelope per item, invalidation before shipping with backstop TTLs, tenant-qualified keys, stampede and cold-start protection, failure semantics, hit-ratio targets with a removal trigger; authorization results never cached by default. | auto + manual |
| `latency-budget-architect` | End-to-end target → per-hop budgets with closing arithmetic: overhead rows, honest fan-out tail math, timeouts DERIVED from budgets with cascade checks, explicit headroom, the budget-claim review rule; consumes SLO targets, never sets them. | auto + manual |
| `frontend-perf-engineer` | The browser's share: metrics pinned to a device/network class, deletion-first weight audit, splitting with a floor, asset/font strategy, SSR/hydration honesty, evidence-based runtime fixes, bundle-size and metric budgets as CI gates. | auto + manual |

D10 Tier 1 — performance/load validation (D23): the QA roadmap's headline
pair; both MEASURE (pre-release validation counterpart to
`slo-reliability-architect`'s production targets), and neither runs against
production without explicit human approval:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `performance-test-harness` | The measurement instrument: per-surface measured set, environment contract stamped on every result, baselines + variance-derived noise bands (single-run diffs banned), thresholds CONSUMED from budget/SLO owners, CI tiers with advisory→blocking promotion, UNRUN as a first-class status. | auto + manual |
| `load-test-planner` | The traffic plan: workload model from production evidence (write share explicit, arrival model chosen), whale + long-tail tenant mix with the noisy-neighbor scenario judged per-tenant, volumes with skew, load/stress/soak/spike by question, ramps with abort criteria, owner-cited pass/fail. | auto + manual |

D12.2 — product engineering craft (D24): the API/UX craft INSIDE the
contract that `api-event-architect` owns (the craft details, not the
contract itself):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `pagination-cursor-designer` | The pagination MECHANISM inside a contract: cursor (keyset) vs offset with drift/deep-page costs stated, opaque versioned cursor (sort key + tiebreaker), strict total ordering, page-size bounds, honest end signaling, the tenant/permission predicate bound server-side (a cross-tenant paging boundary), surface pattern chosen. | auto + manual |
| `error-taxonomy-designer` | The error MODEL: a finite taxonomy with stable machine codes, one envelope (code/message/details/correlation-id/retryable), an honest client-vs-server-vs-retryable split, actionable messages, ONE exception→taxonomy boundary, and a disclosure rule keeping stack traces/internals/PII out. | auto + manual |
| `edge-state-ux-designer` | The per-view non-happy-path state matrix: the three distinct empties (first-run/filtered/error), honest loading (skeleton vs spinner, delay threshold, optimistic rollback), error placement by blast radius, partial failure, refetch/offline, forbidden-not-empty. Renders `error-taxonomy-designer`'s codes. | auto + manual |
| `notification-webhook-ux-designer` | The human-facing UX of notifications (channels, per-category preferences, digest/dedup noise control, read-state, opt-out that works) and developer webhooks (delivery log, test-send, replay, secret rotation with an overlap window); the delivery CONTRACT stays with `api-event-architect`. | auto + manual |
| `mobile-viewport-craft` | Mobile/responsive viewport correctness: content-driven breakpoints, touch-target sizing, safe-area/notch, the 100vh→dvh/svh/lvh fix, input/keyboard behavior, hover-absence and gestures, wide-table reflow; page WEIGHT stays with `frontend-perf-engineer`. | auto + manual |

D12.5 — PM / product-engineering interface (D24): the engineering/PM
boundary. Two hard seams pinned both ways in trigger-evals —
`product-spec-writer` ≠ `adr-writer` (product spec vs architecture
decision) and `sunset-deprecation-communicator` ≠
`skill-deprecation-planner` (product-feature sunset vs library-skill
retirement):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `requirements-gathering-facilitator` | Elicits requirements BEFORE a spec: separates the problem from stakeholders' solutions, draws out users/jobs and the current workaround, surfaces the implicit (assumptions, non-goals, constraints), reconciles conflict to a decider; produces a confidence-marked brief that feeds `product-spec-writer`. Facilitates; does not decide. | auto + manual |
| `product-spec-writer` | The PRODUCT spec: problem/job, goals and explicit non-goals, scenarios, functional requirements with TESTABLE acceptance criteria, edge/error behavior, rollout intent + success metrics, open questions. Pinned ≠ `adr-writer` (a product spec is not an architecture decision record). | auto + manual |
| `roadmap-under-uncertainty-planner` | Horizon-based roadmap (now/next/later) over a false-precision dated Gantt: confidence decaying with distance, learning-first sequencing (retire uncertainty), outcomes over feature lists, capacity slack, a re-plan cadence. Consumes a ranking from `prioritization-frame-picker`. | auto + manual |
| `prioritization-frame-picker` | Picks the RIGHT prioritization frame (RICE/WSJF/value-effort/Kano/MoSCoW) instead of defaulting, marks input reliability, refuses false rigor (buckets + a sensitivity check), and pulls must-dos out of the value formula. Ranks; sequencing over time is `roadmap-under-uncertainty-planner`'s. | auto + manual |
| `feature-flag-rollout-strategist` | The ROLLOUT strategy: flag classified by purpose, progressive stages with advance/rollback criteria, sticky targeting, guardrails + a tested kill switch, a fail-safe default, flag-debt removal. Pinned ≠ `plan-entitlement-architect`/`authorization-matrix-designer` (entitlement/permission) and ≠ `ab-test-designer` (experiment). | auto + manual |
| `sunset-deprecation-communicator` | Sunsetting a PRODUCT feature/API to users: rationale, impact, migration path, a firm timeline, an escalating multi-channel comms plan, grandfathering, and a tombstone (not a silent 404). Pinned ≠ `skill-deprecation-planner` (retiring a library SKILL) and ≠ `api-event-architect` (standing policy). | auto + manual |

D12.6 — growth / analytics engineering (D24): user-facing product
analytics, distinct from system telemetry. The two three-way seams pinned
in trigger-evals — `event-schema-architect` ≠ `api-event-architect` ≠
`streaming-event-architect`, and `product-analytics-instrumenter` ≠
`observability-operator` ≠ `skill-usage-instrumenter`:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `event-schema-architect` | The ANALYTICS event schema/tracking plan: naming taxonomy, typed properties, global properties, identity stitching, a registry as source of truth, additive versioning, PII minimization. THREE-way seam pinned ≠ `api-event-architect` (external contract) ≠ `streaming-event-architect` (internal pipeline). | auto + manual |
| `funnel-definition-designer` | Rigorous funnel/conversion/retention definition: steps from real events, a counting model with a pinned denominator, a stated window, order semantics, attribution, and WHERE-not-WHY discipline (causes need an experiment). Consumes `event-schema-architect`; ≠ `ab-test-designer`. | auto + manual |
| `ab-test-designer` | Designs AND reads experiments: falsifiable hypothesis, one primary metric + guardrails, power/sample-size from a practical MDE, a fixed horizon (no peeking), sticky assignment; readout with CIs, multiple-comparison/SRM/Simpson's/novelty checks, ship/kill/iterate with residual uncertainty. Pinned ≠ `feature-flag-rollout-strategist`. | auto + manual |
| `product-analytics-instrumenter` | The product-analytics INSTRUMENTATION: client-vs-server capture, identity at capture, consent-gating + PII minimization at the source, capture reliability, de-dup, tracking QA. THREE-way seam pinned ≠ `observability-operator` (system telemetry) ≠ `skill-usage-instrumenter` (library usage). | auto + manual |

D12.4 — technical writing / docs engineering (D25): durable documentation
as its own discipline. `adr-sequencer` EXTENDS `adr-writer` (longitudinal
ADR management, composed not duplicated); `docs-retention-index` is the
DOC-lifecycle counterpart to `skill-deprecation-planner` (pinned both
ways); `api-doc-generator-designer` documents the contract
`api-event-architect` owns:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `readme-craftsman` | The README as entry point, not manual: first-screen what/why/who, a verified quickstart, common-case usage, and routes OUT to deeper docs; resists the kitchen sink and stays maintainable. | auto + manual |
| `adr-sequencer` | Longitudinal ADR CORPUS management atop `adr-writer`: the index, status lifecycle, bidirectional superseding links, contradiction detection, new-ADR-vs-amend, and append-only history (supersede, never overwrite). Composes `adr-writer` for single records. | auto + manual |
| `diataxis-doc-organizer` | Organizes the whole docs SET by the four Diátaxis modes (tutorial/how-to/reference/explanation), diagnosing actual-vs-claimed mode, splitting two-job docs, and setting the discipline that keeps modes from bleeding. | auto + manual |
| `docs-as-code-architect` | The docs TOOLCHAIN/pipeline: in-repo PR-reviewed docs, generator choice, per-PR previews, CI link/prose/build checks, executable-sample testing (the drift-killer), versioned publishing, and URL stability. | auto + manual |
| `api-doc-generator-designer` | GENERATED API reference from the source of truth (OpenAPI/GraphQL/docstrings) so it can't drift: the generated-vs-authored split, upstream enrichment, validated examples, versioning. Documents the contract `api-event-architect` owns. | auto + manual |
| `contribution-guide-author` | The zero-to-merged CONTRIBUTING guide: verified setup, the real workflow, automated standards, honest review expectations, governance + private security disclosure, and first-contribution on-ramps. Product-agnostic. | auto + manual |
| `onboarding-doc-designer` | New-hire onboarding: the day1/week1/month1 ramp, verified setup, a mental-model orientation (not the manual), how-we-work incl. unwritten norms, a glossary + who-to-ask, an early-win first task, and a self-heal currency plan. | auto + manual |
| `docs-retention-index` | The numbered DOC-lifecycle index: retention category + reason-to-keep + superseded-by + cleanup rule per doc (mirrored in frontmatter), reverse-reference sweep, staged mark→redirect→remove with human-approved deletion. DOC counterpart to `skill-deprecation-planner` (pinned both ways). | auto + manual |

D12.7 — staff+ IC craft (D26): technical leadership without management
authority. `tech-spec-writer` ≠ `adr-writer` (whole design vs one
decision) ≠ `product-spec-writer`; `phased-work-handoff-designer` ≠
`ai-closeout-reporter` (one turn) ≠ `ai-sdlc-operating-model` (lifecycle);
`staff-scope-selector` ≠ `promotion-packet-writer` (future scope vs past
impact, both ways):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `tech-spec-writer` | The whole-design tech spec / RFC: problem/goals/non-goals, proposed design (data model, APIs, components), alternatives, cross-cutting concerns (security/perf/observability/migration/testing), risks, sign-off. Composes `adr-writer` (decisions) + `architecture-designer` (structure). ≠ one ADR, ≠ product spec. | auto + manual |
| `design-review-facilitator` | Facilitates the design review: pre-read + right reviewers, importance-first discussion, actively elicited dissent, an EXPLICIT outcome (approved/changes/rework/blocked), captured decisions — countering rubber-stamp/bikeshed/HiPPO/no-decision. Reviews a design; doesn't write it. | auto + manual |
| `cross-team-dependency-negotiator` | Cross-team dependencies: two-way map, early surfacing, CONCRETE commitments (deliverable+date+owner both sides), de-risking (stub/flag/parallel), honest accounting for the other team's priorities, and a pre-agreed escalation trigger. The org side; the contract is `api-event-architect`'s. | auto + manual |
| `roadmap-to-commitments-translator` | Extracts the firm-promise subset from a roadmap: commit-able vs aspirational, capacity-grounded (velocity minus maintenance, buffered), dependency-gated, honest date RANGES, and the not-committed gap named. The inverse of `roadmap-under-uncertainty-planner`. | auto + manual |
| `staff-scope-selector` | Chooses a staff+ IC's highest-leverage FUTURE scope: level-relative leverage, under-owned problems, matched to strengths, screened against the traps (only-fun/firefighting/too-narrow/invisible-glue/over-reach), with a rationale + explicit NOT-doing list. ≠ `promotion-packet-writer` (past impact). | auto + manual |
| `promotion-packet-writer` | Assembles the promotion case: impact-not-activity, mapped to every rubric dimension, a sustained pattern, honest gap analysis, corroboration, committee language — no inflation. ≠ `staff-scope-selector` (future scope), ≠ `ai-closeout-reporter` (one task). | auto + manual |
| `phased-work-handoff-designer` | The cross-stage handoff protocol: a decision-ID register carried across stages, per-stage changed/NOT-touched lists, proven-invocation evidence (tell-tale output), deviation flags, and a cold-start continuation contract. ≠ `ai-closeout-reporter` (one turn), ≠ `ai-sdlc-operating-model` (lifecycle). | auto + manual |

D12.9 — architecture advisory (D26): the STYLE/paradigm advisor that filled
the gap between `architecture-designer` (concrete architecture) and
`cloud-architecture-decider` (cloud posture):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture-advisor` | Advises the architecture STYLE (monolith/modular-monolith/microservices/event-driven/serverless/SOA/hybrid): interviews the need FIRST, relevant candidates only, case-specific tradeoffs, a clear recommendation + sensitivity; resists trend-chasing both ways (willing to say "boring modular monolith"). ≠ `architecture-designer` (concrete), `cloud-architecture-decider`, `saas-platform-architect`, `domain-modeler`. | auto + manual |

D14 — framework refresh / source-currency discipline (D26): keeping the
library current with EXTERNAL truth. A pipeline — `framework-edition-tracker`
(detect edition drift + delta) → `framework-mapping-refresher` (propose
edits, human review) — plus `source-currency-auditor` (broad staleness
sweep); none auto-updates:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `framework-edition-tracker` | Tracks cited standard EDITIONS (OWASP/ISO/SOC 2/NIST): an edition register, drift detection, and a DELTA report — verify-don't-assert edition facts; reports drift, updates nothing. Feeds `framework-mapping-refresher`. ≠ broad staleness (`source-currency-auditor`). | auto + manual |
| `framework-mapping-refresher` | Turns a verified edition delta into SPECIFIC proposed edits across affected skills/references/coverage maps, judging meaning-not-labels, surfacing new coverage GAPS, flagged for HUMAN review — never auto-applied. Downstream of `framework-edition-tracker`, upstream of `library-diff-reviewer`. | auto + manual |
| `source-currency-auditor` | Broad citation-currency sweep: inventory external-source citations, volatility-tuned staleness thresholds, flag stale/broken/superseded with reason and load-bearing priority — flags for re-verification, verifies/changes nothing. ≠ edition tracking (`framework-edition-tracker`). | auto + manual |

D28 — OWASP web-app A09/A10 gap closure: the D8 audit's two zero-coverage
OWASP Top 10:2025 categories, built from the Phase 8 backlog — all 10
web-app categories now have an owning skill (A02/A04 remain "partial" by
the D8 rubric). Both edit nothing:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `security-logging-alerting-architect` | The security-event DETECTION/ALERTING design (closes A09:2025): detection coverage map (which events must be logged, with detectable fields), alert-vs-ticket rules with baseline-justified thresholds + bounded noise control, response wiring (owner, severity, escalation, runbook link), coverage tests, honest blind spots. ≠ `audit-log-architect` (records, never detects/alerts), `observability-operator` (implements alert config), `slo-reliability-architect` (reliability paging), `incident-response-runbook` (the playbook AFTER). | auto + manual |
| `error-handling-security-reviewer` | The error/exception-path security REVIEW (closes A10:2025): fail-closed defaults, error-path authorization, exception-driven bypass, leak-free error responses — file:line findings, a fail-closed matrix, missing-negative-test list; recommends fixes, never applies them. ≠ `security-pr-reviewer` (broad diff gate), `appsec-implementer` (builds the fix), `static-analysis-reviewer` (scanner triage), `error-taxonomy-designer` (the error MODEL). | auto + manual |

## Authoring a new skill

1. Read [`docs/skill-generation-standard.md`](docs/skill-generation-standard.md).
2. Copy `.claude/skills/_template/` to `.claude/skills/<your-skill-name>/`.
3. Set frontmatter `name` to match the new directory exactly.
4. Fill in all required sections; keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines (push detail to `references/`).
5. Add `evals/evals.json` (and `evals/trigger-evals.json` if the trigger overlaps another skill).
6. List the skill in [`docs/skills-catalog.md`](docs/skills-catalog.md) **and** this README.
7. Run the validator until it passes.

Side-effecting skills (writes, network, deploy, spend) MUST set `disable-model-invocation: true`
and document the irreversible step under **Stop Conditions**.

## Validation

Run from the repo root:

```bash
python scripts/validate-skills.py
```

Checks: `name` matches directory; `description` present and < 1024 chars; no broad
`allowed-tools`; `SKILL.md` < 500 lines; all required sections present; `evals/evals.json`
exists and parses (structural only — no runner yet); `evals/trigger-evals.json` parses when
present; catalog integrity (every skill listed in catalog + README, none claimed that don't
exist); bundled-name collision and duplicate-name checks.

Behavior: `_template` is ignored. When `_template` is the only skill directory, the validator
prints a "no skills found" status and exits `0`. Exit `0` = clean (warnings allowed); non-zero
= at least one error. Run it before every commit that touches `.claude/skills/`.

## CI (merge gate)

Every pull request targeting `main` runs
[`.github/workflows/validate-skills.yml`](.github/workflows/validate-skills.yml), which
provides two required status checks:

| Check | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `validate-skills` | Runs `python scripts/validate-skills.py` on the PR (latest Python 3.x). Fails on any validator error — same checks as running it locally. |
| `gate-guard` | Diffs the PR against its base and **fails if the PR touches the merge gate itself** (anything under `.github/workflows/` or `scripts/validate-skills.py`). Such PRs print `This PR modifies the merge gate itself and requires manual review and merge.` and must be reviewed and merged manually by a human. |

Notes:

- Both job names are registered as required status checks — do not rename them (and keep
  them unique across all workflows) without updating branch protection.
- A `gate-guard` failure is not a defect; it is the intended signal that the change needs
  human eyes. Fixing the gate to "make CI green" defeats its purpose.
- The gate uses only `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python` — no third-party actions.
- Auto-merge is enabled per-phase via `gh pr merge --auto --squash` — never for changes
  touching the merge gate itself (see
  [`docs/reconciliation/auto-merge-policy.md`](docs/reconciliation/auto-merge-policy.md)).

## Core rules

- Skills are reusable procedures, not essays. Agents are isolated read-only specialists.
- Build in waves. Do not create the backlog at once (the original 300-skill roadmap, per the D12 standing rule a 300+ target backlog — ship on demand and framework coverage, not count; roadmap = backlog, not a batch command).
- Start with standards, templates, eval convention, and validators (Phase 0).
- Every skill needs `SKILL.md` with clear frontmatter, concise workflow, output format,
  validation checklist, gotchas, stop conditions, and `evals/evals.json`.
- Avoid broad `allowed-tools`; use `disable-model-invocation: true` for side-effect workflows.
- Use read-only exploration first for audits, architecture, code, security, and QA review.
- Treat security, tenant isolation, QA evidence, and verification as first-class requirements.
- Keep product-specific skills out of this reusable foundation.

## Safety note

Claude Code Skills and subagents can influence future code, tests, reviews, and tool usage.
Review every generated skill and agent before trusting it. A reusable skill library is useful
only if it is specific, testable, constrained, maintained, and validated.
