# Claude-Skills

Reusable planning + implementation repository for product-agnostic Claude Code **skills**
and read-only project **subagents**.

The goal is not a pile of prompts. The goal is reusable Claude Code Skills and agents that
make Claude behave like a disciplined senior/principal engineering partner: model before
code, docs before implementation, tests before changes, small diffs, tenant isolation and
security by default, QA evidence before release, and evidence-based troubleshooting.

The repo is built in **phases**. **Phase 0** established the foundation — authoring
standard, templates, eval convention, validator, catalog, the seven read-only reviewer
subagents, and the Step 0 reconciliation of the two earlier planning tracks. **Phase 1**
shipped the first real skills: the 8-skill AI engineering **operating-discipline pack**
(reconciled decision D4). **Phase 2** shipped the 10-skill **core architecture &
engineering pack**. **Phase 3** shipped the 9-skill **SaaS & tenant isolation pack**.
**Phase 4** shipped the 9-skill **security, RLS & supply-chain pack**. **Phase 5**
shipped the 16-skill **QA, E2E, manual QA & evidence pack** (the 13 canonical Phase 5
skills plus 3 pulled forward from the QA backlog: roadmap #184/#185/#204). **Phase 1.5**
shipped the 4-skill **AI-SDLC governance completion** (roadmap #261/#268/#279/#280),
completing the category-08 governance layer Phase 1 started. **Phase 6** ships the
10-skill **cloud, DevOps, reliability & release pack** — see
[Skills (shipped)](#skills-shipped) below.

## Subagents (read-only reviewers)

Real project subagents live under `.claude/agents/<name>.md` (reconciled decision D2),
read-only by default. Each maps to a v4 orchestrator role (see reconciliation §5):

| Subagent | Lens |
|---|---|
| `principal-architecture-reviewer` | Architecture boundaries, coupling, data ownership, scalability. |
| `secure-saas-reviewer` | Tenant isolation, RLS, authz, secrets, cross-tenant leakage. |
| `qa-automation-lead` | Test strategy, coverage gaps, flake risk, release evidence. |
| `full-codebase-auditor` | Whole-repo inventory, evidence-based risk, debt map. |
| `senior-troubleshooting-lead` | Reproduction, hypothesis ranking, root cause. |
| `ai-security-red-team-reviewer` | Prompt injection, tool/RAG abuse, data exfil. |
| `release-readiness-reviewer` | CI/build/test evidence, migrations, rollback, go/no-go. |

## Skills (shipped)

Phase 1 — AI engineering operating-discipline pack, under `.claude/skills/<name>/`
(full detail: [`docs/skills-catalog.md`](docs/skills-catalog.md)):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-startup-context-gate` | Verifies repo identity and loads governing context before any work; halts when the location can't be verified (a path that exists is not proof it's the right repo). | auto + manual |
| `source-of-truth-reconciler` | Resolves conflicts between instructions, docs, code, tests, and memory by evidence-cited precedence; surfaces every assumption. | auto + manual |
| `change-classification-gate` | Classifies a change before work → validation floor + approval path; locks scope to the approved class. | auto + manual |
| `human-approval-boundary` | Halts for explicit approval before schema, RLS/security, prod-data, secrets, deploy, billing, or destructive work; stops when security impact is unclear. | auto + manual |
| `reviewable-diff-discipline` | Keeps diffs small and intentional; stages exact files only; staged set must equal declared intent. | auto + manual |
| `ai-closeout-reporter` | Terminal closeout report with a mandatory "intentionally not done / omitted" section — scope reductions are never silent. | auto + manual |
| `agent-failure-recovery` | Preserve-first recovery from broken git/tree state; destructive cleanup only with backup + explicit approval. | **manual only** |
| `agent-instruction-consolidator` | Aligns CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / Cursor / Copilot instruction files to one canonical source with rule-preservation proof. | **manual only** |

Phase 1.5 — AI-SDLC governance completion (roadmap #261/#268/#279/#280; completes the
category-08 layer Phase 1 started — composes the Phase 1 skills, never restates them):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-sdlc-operating-model` | End-to-end human+agent lifecycle contract: named stages with entry/exit gates, per-stage authority (human / agent / agent-with-approval), enforcing skill per stage, failure routing, learning loop; grounded in observed PR practice with a gap list. | auto + manual |
| `agent-authorization-matrix` | Deny-by-default action × context matrix of standing agent authority — merge to protected branches requires a named human always; auto-merge arming is forbidden to agents (armed state re-checked after every push); approval scope/expiry semantics; proposal-first. | **manual only** |
| `agent-memory-governance` | Persistent-memory WRITE/TRUST/HYGIENE rules: confirmed durable facts with provenance and absolute dates, never secrets; remembered repo/PR state verified against live git/gh before acting; disposition-approved cleanups. | **manual only** |
| `agent-governance-audit` | Audits one AI-assisted change's process compliance from primary evidence (PR timeline incl. who armed auto-merge, commits, CI runs): per-control PASS/FAIL/UNVERIFIABLE verdicts; closeout claims cross-checked; missing evidence is never a PASS. | auto + manual |

Phase 2 — core architecture & engineering pack:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `domain-modeler` | Domain model from requirements/code — language, bounded contexts, aggregates with invariants; hard "do not code yet" gate at the end. | auto + manual |
| `architecture-designer` | Inspects the CURRENT architecture first, then component/dependency/data-ownership maps, tradeoffs, ADR draft, and an incremental migration plan. | auto + manual |
| `adr-writer` | Architecture Decision Records with honest alternatives, consequences, operational impact, mandatory rollback/reversal plan and review date. | auto + manual |
| `docs-first-implementer` | Pins the exact installed library version (lockfile), reads version-matching docs before coding, verifies with real commands; declares uncertainty instead of guessing. | auto + manual |
| `tdd-engineer` | Strict red-green-refactor: confirms each test fails for the intended reason before the minimal implementation; reports exact commands and results. | auto + manual |
| `systematic-debugger` | Reproduce → reduce → isolate → fix one thing → verify → prevent; prediction-tested hypotheses, single-variable fixes, regression test kept. | auto + manual |
| `code-reviewer` | Reviews actual diffs only — severity-ranked findings with file:line evidence and remediation; no diff, no review. | auto + manual |
| `code-simplifier` | Behavior-preserving simplification with the suite green before and after every move; coverage gate; restraint ("not done" list) is a deliverable. | **manual only** |
| `principal-code-analyst` | Subsystem-level strategic analysis laddering code findings to architecture, security, cost; risk register + small-step remediation with validation signals. | auto + manual |
| `full-codebase-auditor` | Whole-repo audit with inventory-first coverage; findings filed as confirmed / likely / hypotheses / missing information. (Skill = procedure; same-named subagent composes it.) | auto + manual |

| `saas-cost-architect` | Bill-grounded cost drivers, per-tenant attribution (or admitted overhead), distribution-based unit economics vs revenue, exposure math, guardrails with observe-first rollout. | auto + manual |
| `api-event-architect` | External API/event contracts: credential-derived tenant context, idempotency, per-tenant/plan rate limits, versioning with dual-run deprecation, tenant-scoped signed webhooks. | auto + manual |

Phase 4 — security, RLS & supply-chain pack:

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `threat-modeler` | Design-time threat model: assets/actors/trust-boundaries, STRIDE per boundary, abuse cases, exploit-path-gated severity, mitigations mapped to negative tests; consumes tenant/authz outputs instead of re-deriving them. | auto + manual |

| `rls-policy-auditor` | Per-command RLS audit/authoring (merges rls-policy-author + rls-negative-test-designer): recursion, unsafe SECURITY DEFINER, broad grants, missing tenant scope, service-role leakage, frontend-derived scope; mandatory negative-test plan; policies delivered as a migration, never run live. | auto + manual |
| `secrets-identity-hardener` | Env classification (catches VITE_/NEXT_PUBLIC_ leaks), moves secrets server-side with a client-bundle-absence proof, rotates leaked credentials, least-privilege service accounts, session/token flags. | **manual only** |
| `supply-chain-security-reviewer` | SLSA-style: lockfile-based dependency set, reachability triage of scanner output, install/build-script and CI compromise paths, SHA pinning, compromise-path-gated severity. | auto + manual |
| `security-pr-reviewer` | Security lens on an actual diff: authz/object-level/tenant-scope, injection, secrets, SSRF, control-weakening detection; exploit-path-gated findings; no diff, no review. | auto + manual |
| `secure-migration-reviewer` | Whole-migration deploy safety: RLS/policy gaps, GRANT widening, unsafe defaults, destructive/irreversible ops, tenant-scoped backfills, lock risk, expand→contract deploy order, rollback; delegates policy text to `rls-policy-auditor`. | auto + manual |
| `static-analysis-reviewer` | Triages SAST/CodeQL/SARIF on first-party code: dedup, confirm-against-code disposition (TP/FP/dup/accepted), five-axis ranking (reachability/exploitability/asset/tenant/business), written suppression policy. | auto + manual |

Phase 5 — QA, E2E, manual QA & evidence pack (13 canonical + 3 pulled forward from the

merged into `rollback-runbook-author` per reconciliation §3):

| Skill | What it does | Invocation |
|---|---|---|

## Authoring a new skill

1. Read [`docs/skill-generation-standard.md`](docs/skill-generation-standard.md).
2. Copy `.claude/skills/_template/` to `.claude/skills/<your-skill-name>/`.
3. Set frontmatter `name` to match the new directory exactly.
4. Fill in all required sections; keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines (push detail to `references/`).
5. Add `evals/evals.json` (and `evals/trigger-evals.json` if the trigger overlaps another skill).
6. List the skill in [`docs/skills-catalog.md`](docs/skills-catalog.md) **and** this README.
7. Run the validator until it passes.

Side-effecting skills (writes, network, deploy, spend) MUST set `disable-model-invocation: true`
and document the irreversible step under **Stop Conditions**.

## Validation

Run from the repo root:

```bash
python scripts/validate-skills.py
```

Checks: `name` matches directory; `description` present and < 1024 chars; no broad
`allowed-tools`; `SKILL.md` < 500 lines; all required sections present; `evals/evals.json`
exists and parses (structural only — no runner yet); `evals/trigger-evals.json` parses when
present; catalog integrity (every skill listed in catalog + README, none claimed that don't
exist); bundled-name collision and duplicate-name checks.

Behavior: `_template` is ignored. When `_template` is the only skill directory, the validator
prints a "no skills found" status and exits `0`. Exit `0` = clean (warnings allowed); non-zero
= at least one error. Run it before every commit that touches `.claude/skills/`.

## CI (merge gate)

Every pull request targeting `main` runs
[`.github/workflows/validate-skills.yml`](.github/workflows/validate-skills.yml), which
provides two required status checks:

| Check | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `validate-skills` | Runs `python scripts/validate-skills.py` on the PR (latest Python 3.x). Fails on any validator error — same checks as running it locally. |
| `gate-guard` | Diffs the PR against its base and **fails if the PR touches the merge gate itself** (anything under `.github/workflows/` or `scripts/validate-skills.py`). Such PRs print `This PR modifies the merge gate itself and requires manual review and merge.` and must be reviewed and merged manually by a human. |

Notes:

- Both job names are registered as required status checks — do not rename them (and keep
  them unique across all workflows) without updating branch protection.
- A `gate-guard` failure is not a defect; it is the intended signal that the change needs
  human eyes. Fixing the gate to "make CI green" defeats its purpose.
- The gate uses only `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python` — no third-party actions.
- Auto-merge is enabled per-phase via `gh pr merge --auto --squash` — never for changes
  touching the merge gate itself (see
  [`docs/reconciliation/auto-merge-policy.md`](docs/reconciliation/auto-merge-policy.md)).

## Core rules

- Skills are reusable procedures, not essays. Agents are isolated read-only specialists.
- Build in waves. Do not create all 300 skills at once (roadmap = backlog, not a batch command).
- Start with standards, templates, eval convention, and validators (Phase 0).
- Every skill needs `SKILL.md` with clear frontmatter, concise workflow, output format,
  validation checklist, gotchas, stop conditions, and `evals/evals.json`.
- Avoid broad `allowed-tools`; use `disable-model-invocation: true` for side-effect workflows.
- Use read-only exploration first for audits, architecture, code, security, and QA review.
- Treat security, tenant isolation, QA evidence, and verification as first-class requirements.
- Keep product-specific skills out of this reusable foundation.

## Safety note

Claude Code Skills and subagents can influence future code, tests, reviews, and tool usage.
Review every generated skill and agent before trusting it. A reusable skill library is useful
only if it is specific, testable, constrained, maintained, and validated.
