"""Self-tests for the repo's gate scripts (decisions D55, D60).

Covers scripts/validate-skills.py (D55) and scripts/check_dco.py (D60). The
file name predates the second script; the CI step runs one command, so the
second script's cases live here rather than in a sibling nothing invokes.

Run:  python scripts/tests/test_validator.py      # exit 0 = every assertion held

WHY THIS EXISTS
    validate-skills.py is the repo's single load-bearing merge gate, and until
    D55 it had no tests at all. Every hard check it grew — the D43 README count
    markers, the D50 strict-YAML / sentinel / block-scalar trio — was hand-proved
    once in a pull-request description and never proved again. This suite
    re-proves them on every CI run, so a later refactor cannot quietly disarm
    one. check_dco.py (D60) is held to the same standard from its first day:
    it enforces a merge condition, so it is itself proved able to fail.

NO PYTEST, DELIBERATELY
    The repo's entire dependency surface is one package (PyYAML), and the
    validator fails closed without it. Adding a test framework to test one
    script would invert that minimalism. Plain asserts suffice: the first
    failure prints and exits non-zero.

PROVING THE SUITE CAN FAIL
    A check nobody has watched fail is an assertion, not a gate. Every bad
    fixture here is paired with the specific error text it must produce. To
    confirm the suite is really wired to the validator, neuter one check and
    re-run: comment out the `rep.error(...)` call inside
    check_description_not_block_scalar() and the two block-scalar cases go red
    immediately. Any other check can be checked the same way.

IMPORT WRINKLE
    validate-skills.py is hyphenated, so `import validate_skills` cannot reach
    it; it is loaded by path through importlib below. check_dco.py is loaded
    the same way — not because it must be, but so both gate scripts are reached
    identically and scripts/ never has to be put on sys.path.
