"""Validate skills under .claude/skills/ against the repo skill-generation standard.

Checks performed per skill (see docs/skill-generation-standard.md):
  * SKILL.md exists and has a ----fenced frontmatter block that parses with a
    SPEC-STRICT YAML parser (decision D50 — check_frontmatter_strict_yaml,
    HARD: lenient in-house parsing let 67 descriptions ship that strict
    Agent-Skills consumers such as Codex CLI silently DROP; see the
    "Portability contract" in docs/skill-generation-standard.md).
  * frontmatter `name` exactly equals the skill's directory name.
  * frontmatter `description` present, non-empty, and < 1024 characters
    measured on the strict-PARSED value — quoting characters and doubled
    apostrophes are serialization, not content, and do not count (external
    consumers measure the parsed value; D49 evidence).
  * manual-only skills (`disable-model-invocation: true`) carry the exact
    32-char sentinel "MANUAL-ONLY; never auto-invoke. " as the FIRST 32
    characters of the parsed description (decision D50 —
    check_manual_only_sentinel, HARD: strict consumers ignore the field and
    surface only the description front at selection time, per D49).
  * no BROAD `allowed-tools` grant (e.g. "*", "all", bare "Bash").
  * SKILL.md body is < 500 lines.
  * all nine required sections present (v4 standard): Purpose, Use When,
    Inputs to Inspect, Workflow, Output Format, Validation Checklist, Gotchas,
    Stop Conditions, Supporting Files.
  * evals convention (repo decision D3 — structural only, no runner):
    evals/evals.json exists and parses; evals/trigger-evals.json parses if present.

Repo-level checks:
  * README-catalog integrity: every skill is listed in docs/skills-catalog.md
    AND in README.md.
  * bundled-name collision: no skill name duplicates another skill, and no
    skill name shadows a reserved bundled skill name.
  * README map-matches-territory (decision D43): the README's marked SKILL-COUNT
    equals the real skill count on disk, and the roster's per-family counts (plus
    the one project-orchestrator front door) reconcile with disk and with the
    FAMILY-COUNT marker — both HARD errors. Curated surfaces (roster flagship
    names, the roles table) are checked at WARNING level only, since they are
    human-curated and deliberately not 1:1 with the skill set.

The `_template` directory is ALWAYS ignored (it is a template, not a shipped skill).
When `_template` is the only skill directory, the script prints "no skills found"
and exits 0.

Exit code 0 = clean (possibly with warnings), non-zero = at least one error.
Requires PyYAML for the strict frontmatter parse (decision D50):
`python -m pip install pyyaml`. Fails closed if it is missing. No other
third-party dependencies.
